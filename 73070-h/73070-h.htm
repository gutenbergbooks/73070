  <h2 id='chap1' class='c006'>CHAPTER <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> <br> WHAT IS THE <i>BHAGAVADGITA</i>?</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>In the whole literature of the world there are few poems
worthy of comparison, either in point of general interest, or of
practical influence, with the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i>. It is a philosophical
work, yet fresh and readable as poetry; a book of devotion, yet
drawing its main inspiration from speculative systems; a dramatic
scene from the most fateful battle of early Indian story, yet
breathing the leisure and the subtleties of the schools; founded
on a metaphysical theory originally atheistic,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a> yet teaching the
most reverent adoration of the Lord of all: where shall we find
a more fascinating study? Then its influence on educated India
has been and still is without a rival. Everybody praises the
Upanishads, but very few read them; here and there one finds
a student who turns the pages of a Sūtra or looks into Sankara or
Rāmānuja, but the most are content to believe without seeing.
The <i>Gītā</i>, on the other hand, is read and loved by every educated
man. Nor is there any need to apologize for this partiality: the
Divine Song is the loveliest flower in the garden of Sanskrit
literature.</p>

<p class='c005'>For the Western mind also the poem has many attractions.
The lofty sublimity to which it so often rises, the practical character
of much of its teaching, the enthusiastic devotion to the one
Lord which breathes through it, and the numerous resemblances
it shows to the words of Christ, fill it with unusual interest for
men of the West. But while it has many points of affinity with
the thought and the religion of Europe, it is nevertheless a genuine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>product of the soil;<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a> indeed it is all the more fit to represent
the genius of India that its thought and its poetry are lofty enough
to draw the eyes of the West.</p>

<p class='c005'>What, then, is the <i>Gītā</i>? Can we find our way to the fountain
whence the clear stream flows?</p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>A.</abbr> When the dwelling-place of the ancient Aryan tribes
was partly on the outer, partly on the inner, side of the Indus
(primeval patronymic of both India and her religion), and the
tribesmen were equally at home on the farm and on the battlefield,
then it was that the mass of the lyrics that form the <i>Rigveda</i>
were made. We need not stay to set forth the various ways in
which this unique body of poetry is of value to modern thought.
For us it is of interest because it gives us the earliest glimpse of
the religion of the Indo-Aryans. That religion is polytheistic and
naturalistic. The Vedic hymns laud the powers of nature and
natural phenomena as personal gods. They praise also, as distinct
powers, the departed fathers. Such is undoubtedly the
general character of the religion of that age. On the other hand,
the hymns to Varuna bring us very near monotheism indeed.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>It is, however, only at a later period when the Aryan conquest
had moved out of the Punjab to the South and West, and
just on the eve of the formation of the <i>Rigveda</i> as a collection of
religious hymns, that we find the beginnings of philosophic speculation.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
A few hymns, chiefly in the tenth Mondol, ask questions
about the origin of the universe, and venture some naive guesses
on that tremendous subject. Some of the hymns<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c009'><sup>[5]</sup></a> take for
granted the existence of primeval matter, and ask how or by
whom it was transformed into a <i>cosmos</i>. In others<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c009'><sup>[6]</sup></a> there is more
monotheistic feeling, and a Creator, either Hiranyagarbha or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Visvakarman, is described. In others<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c009'><sup>[7]</sup></a> the strain of thought is
agnostic.</p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>B.</abbr> With the collection of the hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i> we
pass into a new and very different period, the literature of which
is altogether priestly. To this age belong the two great sacerdotal
manuals, the <i>Sāmaveda</i><a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c009'><sup>[8]</sup></a> or Chant-book, and the <i>Yajurveda</i><a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
or Sacrifice-book, and those extraordinary collections of priestly
learning, mythology and mysticism, the Brāhmanas.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a> These books
introduce us to changed times and changed men, to new places
and a new range of ideas. The fresh poetry of the youth of
India has given place to the most prosaic and uninteresting
disquisitions in the whole world.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The home of this literature
is the great holy land of Brahman culture, stretching from the
Sutlej on the West to the junction of the Jumna and the Ganges
at Prayāga.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c009'><sup>[12]</sup></a> In this period the doctrine of the transmigration
of the soul first appears.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c009'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>C.</abbr> The Aranyakas<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c009'><sup>[14]</sup></a> and Upanishads<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c009'><sup>[15]</sup></a> place before us a
further development of Indian religion. Reflection led to the
perception of the great truth, that the kernel of religion is not
the ritual act but the heart of piety behind it. Many a man who
had found the endless formulæ and the showy ceremonial of the
sacrifice a serious hindrance to real religion, sought refuge from
the noise and distraction of the popular cult in the lonely silence
of forest or desert. To run over the sacrifice in one’s own mind,
they reasoned, was as acceptable to the gods as to kill the horse
or to pour the ghee upon the altar fire. But they soon reached
the further position, that for the man who has attained <span class='fss'>TRUE
KNOWLEDGE</span> sacrifice is altogether unnecessary. For knowledge
of the world-soul emancipates a man from the chain of births and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>deaths and leads to true felicity. The main purpose, thus, of the
Upanishads, is to expound the nature of the world-soul. Their
teaching is by no means uniform. Not only do the separate
treatises differ the one from the other; contradictory ideas are
frequently to be met with in the same book. They all tend to
idealistic monism; they all agree in identifying the soul of man
with the world-soul; but on the questions, whether the latter is
personal or impersonal, how spirit and matter are related, and
how the human soul will join the divine soul after death, there is
no unanimity.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c009'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>There is thus no speculative system to be drawn from these
books. Those of their ideas that are held with settled, serious
conviction, are taught rather dogmatically than philosophically;
and, on the other hand, where there is freedom of thought, there
is rather a groping after the truth than any definite train of illuminative
reasoning. Yet this occasional, conversational, unconventional
character gives these simple and sincere treatises their
greatest charm, and fits them for that devotional use to which so
many generations of pious readers have put them. To this early
period there belong only the first great group of prose Upanishads,
the <i>Brihadāranyaka</i>, <i>Chāndogya</i>, <i>Taittirīya</i>, <i>Aitareya</i>,
<i>Kaushītaki</i> and parts of the <i>Kena</i>.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>D.</abbr> In bold contrast to this unsystematic meditation on the
Eternal Spirit there stands out the severe, clear-cut, scientific
system of Kapila,<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a> the first Indian thinker who dared to trust the
unaided human mind. Buddhist tradition recognizes that he preceded
Buddha, and connects him with Kapila-vastu, the birth-place
of Buddha, the site of which was discovered as recently as
December 1896.<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c009'><sup>[19]</sup></a> He drew a sharp distinction between matter
and spirit and declared both to be eternal, without beginning and
without end. The material universe develops in accordance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>with certain laws out of primeval matter, <i>prakriti</i>. Spirit, on
the other hand, exists as an indefinite number of individual souls,
each eternal. There is no supreme divine spirit. The value of
this system lies chiefly in its severely logical method, which
demands that all reasoning shall proceed from the known elements
of experience. It has exercised a very great influence on
Indian thought, partly by its method, but still more perhaps
through its cardinal ideas, the eternity of matter, the eternity of
individual souls, the three <i>gunas</i>, the great cosmic periods, and
<i>kaivalya</i>, <i><abbr class='spell'>i. e.</abbr></i>, the attainment of salvation through the separation
of the soul from matter. This great system is known by the name
Sānkhya, <i><abbr class='spell'>i. e.</abbr></i>, enumeration, seemingly on account of the numbering
of the twenty-five <i>tattvas</i>, or principles, which it sets forth.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c009'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Such is the <i>Sānkhya</i> system; but it would be dangerous to
affirm that the whole came from Kapila; for no treatise written by
him has come down. The earliest systematic manual of the
philosophy extant to-day is the <i>Sānkhya-Kārikā</i> of Isvara-Krishna,
which dates from the early Christian centuries.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c009'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>E.</abbr> Shortly after the Sānkhya system, and in close dependence
upon it, there appeared Buddhism and Jainism; but as
these great religions exercised no very definite influence on the
main stream of Indian thought for several centuries, we shall not
linger over them.</p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>F.</abbr> We notice next the second great group of Upanishads,
the <i>Katha</i>, <i>Isā</i>, <i>Svetāsvatara</i>, <i>Mundaka</i>, <i>Mahānārāyana</i>,<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c009'><sup>[22]</sup></a> which
are all written in verse. That this group is later than the great
prose Upanishads is abundantly clear from the changed form as
well as from the more developed matter. “As contrasted with
the five above-mentioned Upanishads with their awkward Brāhmana
style and their allegorical interpretations of the ritual, the
<i>Katha Upanishad</i> belongs to a very different period, a time in
which men began to coin the gold of Upanishad thought into
separate metrical aphorisms, and to arrange them together in a
more or less loose connection.”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c009'><sup>[23]</sup></a> Further signs of their belonging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>to another stage of thought are their references, more or less
clear, to the Sānkhya and Yoga philosophies,<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c009'><sup>[24]</sup></a> and their tendency
to adopt the doctrine of Grace,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c009'><sup>[25]</sup></a> <i><abbr class='spell'>i.e.</abbr></i>, that salvation is not a fruit of
true knowledge, but a gift of God. The idea of <i>Bhakti</i>, which
became afterwards so popular, appears in this group of Upanishads
only once.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c009'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Here also for the first time in Sanskrit literature the
word <i>Sānkhya</i> occurs as the name of a system.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c009'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>But while these five metrical treatises are clearly later than
the prose Upanishads, scholars are not agreed on the question of
their relation to the great systems. Some<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c009'><sup>[28]</sup></a> hold that the <i>Katha</i>
is earlier, others<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c009'><sup>[29]</sup></a> that it is later, than Buddhism; Weber<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c009'><sup>[30]</sup></a> believes
that the <i>Svetāsvatara</i>, <i>Mundaka</i>, and <i>Mahānārāyana</i> depend not
only on Kapila’s system, but also on the <i>Yoga Sūtras</i> of Patanjali
(see below), while others<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c009'><sup>[31]</sup></a> believe that in these Upanishads
we have scattered pieces of teaching which were later systematized.
But whatever be the truth on these points, it is clear that
these five are posterior to the first group, that their relative age is
<i>Katha</i>, <i>Isā</i>, <i>Svetāsvatara</i>, <i>Mundaka</i> and <i>Mahānārāyana</i>,<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c009'><sup>[32]</sup></a> and
that this last belongs to quite a late date.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c009'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Along with these
verse Upanishads we may take three prose works, which are
manifestly still later,<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c009'><sup>[34]</sup></a> the <i>Prasna</i>, <i>Maitrāyanīya</i> and <i>Māndūkya</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>G.</abbr> Several centuries after the Sānkhya there appeared the
Yoga philosophy, the text-book of which is the <i>Yoga Sūtras</i>.
According to Indian tradition the founder of the school and the
author of the Sūtras was Patanjali,<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c009'><sup>[35]</sup></a> the well-known scholar who
wrote the <i>Mahābhāshya</i> on Pānini’s grammar. He accepts the
metaphysics of the Sānkhya system, but postulates the existence
of a personal god, and urges the value of Yoga practices for the
attainment of <i>Kaivalya</i>, that isolation of the soul from matter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>which, according to Kapila, is true salvation. Thus not one of
the three main elements of his system is original; for Yoga
practices have existed from a very early date in India. Yet his
system is sufficiently marked off from others, first by his combination
of Yoga practices with Sānkhya principles and a theistic
theology, and, secondly, by his systematic treatment of Yoga
methods.<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c009'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>H.</abbr> Later still than the Yoga philosophy is the systematic
statement of the Vedānta point of view by Bādarāyana in his
Sūtras, which are known either as <i>Brahma-sūtras</i>, <i>Sārīraka-sūtras</i>
or <i>Vedānta-sūtras</i>.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c009'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>I.</abbr> We next notice the latest development of Upanishad
teaching, namely, that found in the Upanishads of the <i>Atharvaveda</i>.
With the exception of three, namely, the <i>Mundaka</i>, <i>Prasna</i>
and <i>Māndūkya</i> Upanishads, which we have already noticed, they
are all very late.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c009'><sup>[38]</sup></a> They fall into four great groups, according as
they teach (<i><abbr class='spell'>a</abbr></i>) pure Vedantism, (<i><abbr class='spell'>b</abbr></i>) Yoga practices, (<i><abbr class='spell'>c</abbr></i>) the life of
the Sannyāsin, or (<i><abbr class='spell'>d</abbr></i>) Sectarianism.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c009'><sup>[39]</sup></a> For our purpose the last of
the four is of the most importance. “These sectarian treatises
interpret the popular gods Siva (under various names, such as
Isāna, Mahesvara, Mahādeva) and Vishnu (as Nārāyana and
Nrishinha) as personifications of the Atman. The different
Avatārs of Vishnu are here regarded as human manifestations of
the Atman.”<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c009'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Let readers note that the doctrine of Avatārs is
quite unknown in the Vedas, the Brāhmanas, the early Upanishads
and the Sūtras.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c009'><sup>[41]</sup></a> We may also note that in groups (<i><abbr class='spell'>a</abbr></i>) and
(<i><abbr class='spell'>b</abbr></i>) we find what is not found in earlier Upanishads, namely, the
phrase <i>Sānkhya-Yoga</i> used as the name of a system.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c009'><sup>[42]</sup></a> Here also
the doctrines of Grace and <i>Bhakti</i>, the beginnings of which we
found in the verse Upanishads, are regularly taught.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><abbr class='spell'>J.</abbr> The last development that we need mention is the teaching
of the <i>Mahābhārata</i> and <i>Manu</i>. We take them together,
not only because each of them is the final product of long
centuries of growth and compilation, but because they are so
closely related to each other in origin, that it is hardly possible
to take them separately.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c009'><sup>[43]</sup></a> In the first book of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>
we are told that the poem originally consisted of only 8,800
<i>slokas</i>, and that at a later date the number was 24,000. The
complete work now contains over 100,000 <i>slokas</i>.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c009'><sup>[44]</sup></a> We need not
here enquire when the simple heroic lays were composed, which
lie at the basis of the great composition as it has come down to
us; nor need we stay to decide at what period it finally reached its
present labyrinthine structure and immense dimensions.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c009'><sup>[45]</sup></a> It is
sufficient for our purpose to notice that scientific investigations
have laid bare four stages in the formation of the Epic:—(<i><abbr class='spell'>a</abbr></i>)
early heroic songs, strung together into some kind of unity: this
is the stage recognised in Book <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>, when the poem had only 8,800
<i>slokas</i>, and is in all probability the point at which it is referred to
by Asvalāyana; (<i><abbr class='spell'>b</abbr></i>) a Mahābhārata story with Pandu heroes, and
Krishna as a demi-god: this is the form in which it had 24,000
<i>slokas</i>, and is the stage of the poem referred to by Pānini; (<i><abbr class='spell'>c</abbr></i>) the
Epic re-cast, with Krishna as All-god, and a great deal of didactic
matter added; (<i><abbr class='spell'>d</abbr></i>) later interpolations.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c009'><sup>[46]</sup></a> Scholars are able to fix,
within certain limits, the dates of these various stages. We need
not attempt to be so precise: for us it is enough that <i>the representation
of Krishna as the Atman belongs to the third stage of the
growth of the Epic</i>. Parallel with this third stage is the final redaction
of <i>Manu</i>.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c009'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The philosophic standpoint of these two great
works is practically the same, being now the <i>Sānkhya-Yoga</i>, now
a mixture of Sānkhya, Yoga and Vedantic elements.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c009'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>But the main thing to notice is that in these books we are
already in modern Hinduism. Turning from the Vedas to them
we find ourselves in an altogether new world. There are many
new gods; most of the old divinities have fallen to subordinate
places. New customs, new names and ideas are found everywhere.
The language too has changed: new words, new expressions and
new forms occur in plenty; old words occur in new senses;
while many others have disappeared.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c009'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c005'>Let us now turn to the <i>Gītā</i>. What is its place in this long
succession? Clearly it is posterior, not only to our first, but also
to our second group of Upanishads. For it echoes the <i>Katha</i>,
the <i>Svetāsvatara</i>, and several of the others repeatedly;<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c009'><sup>[50]</sup></a> its
versification is decidedly later in character;<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c009'><sup>[51]</sup></a> the doctrines of
Grace and of <i>Bhakti</i>, which are found in these Upanishads only
in germ, are fully developed in the <i>Gītā</i>;<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c009'><sup>[52]</sup></a> while the whole theory
of Krishna is a fresh growth.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <i>Gītā</i> may also be shewn to belong to the same age as the
Atharvan Upanishads. It has in common with them (<i><abbr class='spell'>a</abbr></i>) the
identification of Krishna and Vishnu with the <i>Atman</i>, (<i><abbr class='spell'>b</abbr></i>) the
doctrine of Avatārs,<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c009'><sup>[53]</sup></a> (<i><abbr class='spell'>c</abbr></i>) the doctrines of Grace and <i>Bhakti</i>, (<i><abbr class='spell'>d</abbr></i>)
the Sānkhya-Yoga.</p>

<p class='c005'>But we may go further, and show that the <i>Gītā</i> is in its teaching,
in general, parallel with the third stage of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>
and with <i>Manu</i>. For while the usual philosophic standpoint in the
Song is Sānkhya-Yoga, there are frequent lapses to the Vedānta;
and there is an evident effort here and there to combine all three.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c009'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
This is precisely the position of <i>Manu</i> and the Epic, as we have
seen. Note that in the <i>Gītā</i> the Yoga philosophy is already old,
so old that it has fallen into decay, and requires to be resuscitated.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c009'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
The Sānkhya is not a loose group of ideas, but a formed
system, as appears from the phrases <i>Sānkhya-Kritānta</i><a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c009'><sup>[56]</sup></a> and
<i>Guna-sankhyāna</i>.<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c009'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Kapila, its author, is so far in the past that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>is canonized as the chief of the <i>Siddhas</i>.<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c009'><sup>[58]</sup></a> There are many minor
points which the <i>Gītā</i> holds in common with the <i>Mahābhārata</i>, and
which are not found earlier. The latter half of the tenth chapter
is full of Epic mythology. There Skanda is the great warrior-god,<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c009'><sup>[59]</sup></a>
as in the <i>Mahābhārata</i>,<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c009'><sup>[60]</sup></a> there too we find the horse Uccaihsravas,<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c009'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
the elephant Airāvata,<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c009'><sup>[62]</sup></a> the snake Vāsuki,<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c009'><sup>[63]</sup></a> the fish
Makara.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c009'><sup>[64]</sup></a> <i>Nirvāna</i> is used in the <i>Gītā</i><a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c009'><sup>[65]</sup></a> for ‘highest bliss,’
‘Brahmic bliss,’ precisely as in the Epic.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c009'><sup>[66]</sup></a> In the <i>Mahābhārata</i>
Bhīshma, after receiving his mortal wound, has to wait for the
<i>Uttarāyana</i> (the northward journey of the sun), <i><abbr class='spell'>i. e.</abbr></i>, he has to
wait until the sun passes the southern solstice, before he can die
in safety.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c009'><sup>[67]</sup></a> In the <i>Gītā</i> we find a similar idea: only those devotees
who die during the <i>Uttarāyana</i> go to Brahman; those who
die during the <i>Dakshināvana</i> return to earth.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c009'><sup>[68]</sup></a> This dogma is
not found in the early Upanishads nor yet in the Sūtras.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c009'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>A study of the language of the <i>Gītā</i><a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c009'><sup>[70]</sup></a> leads to the same conclusion.
A portion of its vocabulary is the same as that of the
first group of Upanishads; a larger portion coincides with our
second group; a still larger coincides with the diction of the
Atharvan group; and finally, much that is found in no Upanishad
is characteristic of the Epic.</p>

<p class='c005'>We need not attempt to fix the date<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c009'><sup>[71]</sup></a> of the poem, for that is
not only impossible as yet, but is quite unnecessary for our purpose.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>What we wish to do is to show that the religious literature of
India displays a long, regular, evolutionary process, that the <i>Gītā</i>
belongs to the same period as the third stage of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>,
and is itself clearly the result of all the preceding development.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c005'>Can we then accept the declaration of the poem itself, that
it was uttered by Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra?—That
necessarily depends upon the history and the chronology.
At what point then in the historical development of the literature
which we have been studying does the famous battle stand?—According
to all scholars the great war and the compilation of
the <i>Vedas</i> both belong to the same period.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c009'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The results of our study may, therefore, be tabulated as
follows, with the proviso that the long process of the growth
of the Epic cannot be fully represented:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>It has thus become perfectly clear that <span class='sc'>The Gītā cannot
have been uttered on the battlefield of Kurukshetra</span>;
for it is the last member of a long series, the final product of a
clearly defined and elaborate process of development. To ascribe
the <i>Gītā</i> to the age of Kurukshetra is much the same as if one
were to ascribe the poetry of Tennyson to the age of Alfred the
Great. A thousand years intervene; the thought and toil of a
millennium were needed to produce the great result.</p>

<p class='c005'>Had Krishna uttered these doctrines on the famous battlefield,
we should inevitably have found references to them in the literature
produced during the following centuries. But where in the
Brāhmanas do we find any of the leading ideas of the <i>Gītā</i>?
Even if men had disbelieved Krishna, his claim to be God incarnate
would at least have drawn out a protest; but in no single
Brāhmana or early Upanishad is there the slightest hint of anything
of the kind. So far from there being any corroboration of the
great myth in early literature, there is the clearest proof that it is
false. In the <i>Kāthaka</i> recension of the <i>Black Yajur Veda</i> king
Dhritarāshtra is mentioned as a well-known person<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c009'><sup>[73]</sup></a>; yet in the
whole literature of the Black Yajur there is no suggestion that
Krishna claimed divine honours. <i>The Satapatha Brāhmana</i>,
which is a product of the <i>Kuru-Panchāla</i> country,<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c009'><sup>[74]</sup></a> contains the
names of a number of the heroes of the great war,<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c009'><sup>[75]</sup></a> but never refers
to Krishna as God incarnate; while in the <i>Chāndogya Upanishad</i>,<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c009'><sup>[76]</sup></a>
which belongs to the same district,<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c009'><sup>[77]</sup></a> he is spoken of merely as a
man: he is mentioned as a pupil of Ghora Angirasa and is called
Krishna Devakiputra.<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c009'><sup>[78]</sup></a> Nay, even in the earliest part of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>
itself Krishna is only a great chief, and not a deity at all.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c009'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Finally, the references to Pandu heroes and to the worship of
Krishna and Arjuna in Pānini,<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c009'><sup>[80]</sup></a> would lead to the conclusion
that in Pānini’s day Krishna was not regarded as the supreme
God, but as one among many;<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c009'><sup>[81]</sup></a> and this cautious inference is
corroborated by the fact that the <i>Mahābhāshya</i> itself does not
recognize him as the incarnation of Brahma, but as a hero and
demi-god.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c009'><sup>[82]</sup></a> <i>Thus the whole of the Vedic literature, and the whole
of the Sūtra literature, are destitute of a single reference to Krishna
as the incarnation of the Supreme.</i> There is only one conclusion
to be drawn from this overwhelming mass of evidence.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c009'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>It is strange that educated Hindus should have clung so long
to the idea that the <i>Gītā</i> is a real utterance of Krishna. The very
fact that the poem has always been regarded, not as <i>Sruti</i>, but
simply as <i>Smriti</i>, should have been enough to suggest the truth.
A piece of genuine divine teaching, uttered in such circumstances,
and before the composition of the earliest Upanishads, would
have inevitably found a place among the most authoritative
scriptures of the faith. The fact of its having been always
regarded as <i>Smriti</i> is sufficient proof by itself that the book does
not belong to the Vedic age at all. Another consideration ought
also by itself to have been sufficient to save Hindus from such
a grave error, namely, this, that <i>no great religious advance or
upheaval followed the time when Krishna is supposed to have
lived and taught</i>. Contrast the mighty revolutions that followed
the work of Buddha, of Christ and of Mahommed; and the
emptiness of the Krishna claim will become at once apparent.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, the subject of all the early Upanishads is the nature
of the Supreme Spirit, whether called the <i>Atman</i> or <i>Brahma</i>. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>on the field of Kurukshetra, Krishna had claimed to be the
Supreme, as the <i>Gītā</i> says he did, can any one believe that the
claim could have been passed unnoticed in the Upanishads?
Krishna is mentioned in the <i>Chāndogya</i>; Brahma is the subject
of the <i>Chāndogya</i>: yet there is not the slightest hint anywhere
that Brahma has been incarnated, far less that Krishna is Brahma.
Such evidence is surely irresistible.</p>

<p class='c005'>One reason why the truth about this myth has been so long
in finding its way into the minds of educated Hindus is undoubtedly
to be found in the wretchedly inadequate way in which
Sanskrit literature is taught in the Universities of India. In
Calcutta at least most men who take Sanskrit as one of their subjects
for the <abbr class='spell'>B. A.</abbr> Degree get through their examination without
having the slightest knowledge of the history of the literature.<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c009'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
For some curious results of this very deficient training, see the
Appendix.</p>

<p class='c005'>With Krishna, all the other so-called Avatārs vanish; for they
rest on foundations still more flimsy and fanciful. They merely
serve as signal proofs of the tendency inherent in the Hindu mind
to believe in incarnations and to see such around them. This
tendency was already living and creative long before the Christian
era, and it has kept its vitality down to the present day; for
though Chaitanya, the sixteenth-century reformer, is the most
noteworthy of those who within recent times have been counted
Avatārs, he is by no means the last: the late Ramkrishna Paramhamsa
was regarded as such,<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c009'><sup>[85]</sup></a> and some of her admirers claim
the same honour for Mrs. Annie Besant.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c009'><sup>[86]</sup></a> Further, this making
of Avatārs is but one aspect of that passion for deifying men which
has characterized Hinduism from first to last,<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c009'><sup>[87]</sup></a> a passion which
has set many a modern Englishman among the gods. Even such
a whole-hearted Christian as John Nicholson did not escape.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c009'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The story, then, that Krishna uttered the Song on the battlefield,
is a pious imagination. All scholars hold the war to be
historical; Krishna’s name can be traced in the literature from the
Upanishads downwards; it is possible, or even probable, that he
was a Kshattriya prince<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c009'><sup>[89]</sup></a> who fought in the war; but <i>the assertion
that on the field he claimed to be the supreme being, is absolutely
negatived by all the early history and literature of India</i>.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c005'>How then are we to account for the <i>Gītā</i>? Whence came
its power and its beauty? and how did it reach the form it has?—We
must recognise the action of three factors in the formation of
the Song, the philosophy, the worship of Krishna, and the author.
We have already traced in outline the genesis of the philosophy;
there remain the cult and the author.</p>

<p class='c005'>All our scholars recognize that Krishna-worship has existed in
India since the fourth century <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> at least; for there can be no
doubt that, when Megasthenes says that Herakles was worshipped
in Methora and Kleisobora,<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c009'><sup>[90]</sup></a> he means that Krishna was worshipped
in Mathura and Krishnapur. How much further back the
cult goes we have no means of learning. Nor does it really
matter for our purpose. The important thing to realize is the
existence of this worship of Krishna, before his identification with
Vishnu<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c009'><sup>[91]</sup></a> and final exaltation to the place of the supreme pantheistic
divinity.</p>

<p class='c005'>The author of the <i>Gītā</i> was clearly a man of wide and deep
culture. He had filled his mind with the best religious philosophy
of his country. He was catholic rather than critical, more inclined
to piece things together than to worry over the differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>between them. Each of the philosophic systems appealed to his
sympathetic mind: he was more impressed with the value of each
than with the distinctions between them. But his was not only a
cultured but a most reverent mind. He was as fully in sympathy
with Krishna-worship as with the philosophy of the Atman. Indeed,
it was the union of these qualities in him that fitted
him to produce the noblest and purest expression of modern
Hinduism. For Hinduism is just the marriage of ancient
Brāhmanical thought and law with the popular cults. But
without his splendid literary gifts the miracle would not have been
possible. The beauty, precision and power of the diction of the
poem, and its dignity of thought, rising now and then to sublimity,
reveal but one aspect of his masterly literary ability.
Much of the success of the poem arises from his genuine appreciation
of the early heroic poems, which he heard recited around
him, and from his consequent decision to make his own Song, in
one sense at least, a heroic poem. Lastly, there is the shaping
spirit of imagination, without which no man can be a real poet.
With him this power was introspective rather than dramatic.
No poet with any genuine dramatic faculty would have dreamed
of representing a warrior as entering on a long philosophic discussion
on the field of battle at the very moment when the armies
stood ready to clash. On the other hand, what marvellous insight
is displayed in his representation of Krishna! Who else could
have imagined with such success how an incarnate god would
speak of himself? Nor must we pass on without noticing that,
though the situation in which the Song is supposed to have been
produced is an impossible one, yet for the author’s purpose it is
most admirably conceived: how otherwise could the main thought
of the book—<i>philosophic calm leading to disinterested action</i>—have
been so vividly impressed on the imagination?</p>

<p class='c005'>This author, then, formed the idea of combining the loftiest
philosophy of his country with the worship of Krishna. He
would intertwine the speculative thought that satisfied the intellect
with the fervid devotion which even the uncultured felt for a god
who was believed to have walked the earth. Philosophy would
thus come nearer religion, while religion would be placed on far
surer intellectual ground. His tastes led him to connect his work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>with the romantic poems of the day; his genius suggested the
situation, a dialogue between a noble knight and the incarnate
divinity; his catholicity taught him to interweave the Sānkhya
with the Yoga and both with the Vedānta; and as we have seen,
his penetrative imagination was equal to the creation of the
subjective consciousness of a god-man.</p>

<p class='c005'>We can now answer the question which stands at the head
of this chapter, What is the <i>Bhagavadgītā</i>? It consists of two
distinct elements, one old, one original. The philosophy is old;
for it is only a very imperfect combination<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c009'><sup>[92]</sup></a> of what is taught
in earlier books. The original element is the teaching put into
Krishna’s mouth about his own person and the relation in which
he stands to his own worshippers and to others. Of this part
of the teaching of the <i>Gītā</i> we here give a brief analysis:—</p>

<p class='c013'>Krishna is first of all the source of the visible world. All
comes from him,<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c009'><sup>[93]</sup></a> all rests in him.<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c009'><sup>[94]</sup></a> At the end of a Kalpa
everything returns to him,<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c009'><sup>[95]</sup></a> and is again reproduced.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c009'><sup>[96]</sup></a>
He pervades all things;<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c009'><sup>[97]</sup></a> and again, in another sense,
he is all that is best and most beautiful in nature and
in man.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c009'><sup>[98]</sup></a> But while Krishna is thus the supreme
power in the universe,<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c009'><sup>[99]</sup></a> he is altogether without personal
interest in the activity therein displayed:<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c009'><sup>[100]</sup></a> he sits unconcerned,<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c009'><sup>[101]</sup></a>
always engaged in action,<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c009'><sup>[102]</sup></a> yet controlling
his own nature,<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c009'><sup>[103]</sup></a> and therefore never becoming bound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>by the results of his action.<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c009'><sup>[104]</sup></a> This conception of the
Supreme, as at once the centre of all activity and yet
completely detached, enables the author, on the one
hand, to soften the seemingly hopeless contradiction
involved in identifying the king, warrior and demon-slayer,
Krishna, with the passionless, characterless
<i>Atman</i><a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c009'><sup>[105]</sup></a> of the Upanishads, and, on the other to
hold up Krishna as the supreme example of Action
Yoga.</p>

<p class='c014'>We now turn to Krishna’s relation to his worshippers.
Knowledge is good;<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c009'><sup>[106]</sup></a> mental concentration is better;<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c009'><sup>[107]</sup></a>
disinterested action is better than either;<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c009'><sup>[108]</sup></a> but the
supreme wisdom is faith in Krishna and boundless
devotion to him.<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c009'><sup>[109]</sup></a> Such is the teaching of the <i>Gītā</i>.
The worst epithets are kept for those who fail to
recognise him as the Supreme, who disregard him,
carp at him, hate him.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c009'><sup>[110]</sup></a> To those who resort to
Krishna,<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c009'><sup>[111]</sup></a> who place faith in him,<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c009'><sup>[112]</sup></a> who shower on

them are promised forgiveness,<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c009'><sup>[117]</sup></a> release from the

<p class='c014'>Since all the gods come from Krishna,<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c009'><sup>[123]</sup></a> and since he is in
the last resort the sole reality,<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c009'><sup>[124]</sup></a> worship offered to
other gods is in a sense offered to him.<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c009'><sup>[125]</sup></a> He accepts
it and rewards it.<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c009'><sup>[126]</sup></a> This is in accordance with his
indifference to men: to him no one is hateful, no one
dear.<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c009'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Yet the highest blessings fall only to those
who recognize him directly.<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c009'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Clearly our author formed his conception of the man-god
with great skill, and fitted it into his general scheme with all the
care and precision he was capable of. On this elaboration of
the self-consciousness of Krishna he concentrated all his intellectual
and imaginative powers. And with what unequalled success!
Could any greater compliment be paid an author than to have
sixty generations of cultured readers take the creation of his
mind for a transcript from history?</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c005'>The masses of evidence we have marshalled to prove that
Krishna never claimed to be God, may be briefly summarised as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The situation in which the <i>Gītā</i> is said to have been
uttered at once strikes the historical student as suspicious: one
can scarcely believe that there was ever a battle in which such
a thing could have taken place; and, on the other hand, it makes
such an excellent background to the theory of Action Yoga, that
one cannot help believing that it was invented for the very
purpose. Further investigation leads to the following results:—</p>

<p class='c005'>2. The characteristic religious and philosophical ideas of
the <i>Gītā</i> are not found in any books produced immediately after
the age of Kurukshetra. If we start with the teaching of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>age, we have to trace the stages of a long and clearly-marked
development before we reach the ideas of the <i>Gītā</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. The diction of the <i>Gītā</i> is not the Vedic Sanskrit of the
early <i>Brāhmanas</i> (which are the literature of the period following
Kurukshetra), but belongs to a very much later stage of the
language.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. The fact that the <i>Gītā</i> is not <i>sruti</i>, but <i>smriti</i>, proves that
it comes neither from Krishna, nor from the time of Kurukshetra.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. Krishna Devakiputra is known in the later Vedic literature
as a man, and in the Sūtra literature as a hero or demi-god, but
never as the supreme being.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. The fact that there is not a single reference in the whole
of the Vedic literature, nor yet in the Sūtra literature, to Krishna
as the incarnation of Brahma, makes it impossible for us to
believe that at the battle of Kurukshetra he claimed to be such.</p>

<p class='c005'>7. The fact that there was no revival or reformation of
religion in the age of Kurukshetra proves that God was not
incarnated then.</p>

  <h2 id='chap2' class='c006'>CHAPTER <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr> <br> PLATO’S JUST MAN.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>We must now leave the land of Bhārata and seek the shores
of Greece.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the fifth century, <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>, Athens became the focus of
Hellenic culture. Her achievements in the Persian wars had
given her very distinctly the leadership of all the Greek states;
and the steady progress of her commerce brought her not only
wealth but abundant intercourse with other cities. So that in
the latter half of the century we find the peculiar genius of Hellas
displayed in Athens with unexampled vigour, variety and splendour.
But space will not allow us even to outline the achievements
of that incomparable age in the various provinces of human
culture. We must confine our attention to philosophy.</p>

<p class='c005'>The general advance of intelligence, education and culture
in Greece produced the only result possible in communities whose
religion was a traditional polytheism and whose morality rested
merely on custom and proverbial wisdom: scepticism, both
religious and ethical, broke in like a flood. Tradition and
custom could not withstand the corrosive influences of fresh
thought fed by deepening experience and widening science. The
Sophists were the exponents, but scarcely the creators, of this
sceptical habit of thought. The philosophers had not done much
to cause it, and they could do as little to cure it. Their theories
dealt with nature rather than man, and stood in no clear relation
to the problems that agitated every thinking mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was at Athens that this sceptical spirit showed itself most
conspicuously, now in the lectures of the chief Sophists of
Hellas, naturally drawn to the centre of intellectual ferment, now
in the stately tragedies of her Dionysiac festivals, now in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><i>fin-de-siècle</i> conversation of her gilded youth. The timid, the old-fashioned,
the conservative scolded and sputtered and threatened,
blaming individuals instead of the time spirit, but had no healing
word to utter.<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c009'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>From the very centre of the disturbance came the new spirit
of order and restoration: Socrates, the Athenian, saved Greece.
The older philosophers had discussed nature; he turned all his
attention to practical human life. Like the Sophists, he trusted
human reason; but unlike them, he aimed not at a display of
intellectual dexterity but at reaching the actual basis of human
morality, society and politics. Human conduct was the sole
subject of his thought and his conversation. Hence the definite,
practical value of his influence: his teaching stood in the closest
possible relation to life and to the problems of the time. On the
other hand, he began with introspection; self-knowledge was what
he demanded of every disciple. Hence the inexhaustible significance
of his work for philosophy. He gave no set lessons to his
pupils, delivered no lectures, wrote no books. He spent his whole
time in conversation with individuals, proceeding always by
question and answer, thus compelling his companion to think for
himself. His extraordinary intellectual skill and the loftiness and
simplicity of his character drew all the best intellects of Athens
around him. But what gives him his unchallenged supremacy in
the history of Greek thought is the fact, that in his hands the
sceptical thought, which had caused such dismay everywhere,
proved to be the very means of revealing the great realities which
men had feared for.<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c009'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>In 399 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>, when he was an old man of seventy years of age,
a number of his fellow-citizens brought a criminal case against
him, charging him with corrupting the youth of Athens and with
impiety. He was tried, found guilty and sentenced to death. A
month later he drank the hemlock—such was the Athenian mode
of execution—surrounded by his friends.<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c009'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>How tragic! Athens, “the school of Hellas,”<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c009'><sup>[132]</sup></a> kills her
greatest teacher! Socrates, the father of ethical philosophy, the
founder of the critical method, the ideal instructor, dies as an
impious corruptor of the youth of Athens!</p>

<p class='c005'>But Socrates was not merely the greatest teacher of his day.
All subsequent Greek philosophy is filled with his spirit; indeed
the leading schools of thought were founded by his pupils.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c009'><sup>[133]</sup></a> Consequently
he is the fountain-head of all Western philosophy and
science; for in both Greece was the school-mistress of Europe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among all the disciples, Plato best represents the master’s
spirit. The Megarians, the Cynics, the Cyrenaics, and, at a later
date, the Stoics and the Epicureans, certainly carried on the
work of Socrates, but they are deflections from the straight
line: they are “imperfect schools,” as Zeller calls them.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c009'><sup>[134]</sup></a> Plato
is in the direct line of succession.</p>

<p class='c005'>He was about twenty years of age when he began to listen
to Socrates. Eight years later came the death of the great
teacher. Plato then left Athens and spent a number of years in
travel and in study in different places. About 390 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>, however,
he returned to the city and set up a philosophical school in a
garden called Academia. For forty years thereafter he was the
acknowledged leader of philosophic thought and teaching in
Athens.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c009'><sup>[135]</sup></a> His influence since his death has rested chiefly on his
Dialogues, one of the most perfect literary treasures in the Greek
language. The form of these beautiful compositions still reflects
the question-and-answer method of Plato’s master; and the
debt of the pupil is everywhere acknowledged; for in most of the
Dialogues Socrates is the chief interlocutor.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c009'><sup>[136]</sup></a> Among the Dialogues
the <i>Republic</i> is universally recognized as the most precious;
for it shows us not only his literary art at its highest, but the
thought of his matured mind: it represents Plato in his strength.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c009'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>The subject of the <i>Republic</i> is “What is Justice?” It is
thus the culmination of the ethical teaching of Socrates. Among
the preliminary discussions in this book there occurs a very
striking conversation between Glaucon and Socrates, in which the
former gives two ideal portraits, one of a man consummately
unjust, the other of a man altogether just. Here is the passage:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“But in actually deciding between the lives of the two persons in
question, we shall be enabled to arrive at a correct conclusion by contrasting
together the thoroughly just and the thoroughly unjust man,—and
only by so doing. Well then, how are we to contrast them? In this way.
Let us make no deduction either from the injustice of the unjust, or from
the justice of the just, but let us suppose each to be perfect in his own line of
conduct. First of all then, the unjust man must act as skilful craftsmen do.
For a first-rate pilot or physician perceives the difference between what is
practicable and what is impracticable in his art, and while he attempts the
former, he lets the latter alone; and, moreover, should he happen to
make a false step, he is able to recover himself. In the same way, if
we are to form a conception of a consummately unjust man, we must
suppose that he makes no mistake in the prosecution of his unjust
enterprises and that he escapes detection: but if he be found out, we
must look upon him as a bungler; for it is the perfection of injustice
to seem just without really being so. We must, therefore, grant to the
perfectly unjust man, without any deduction, the most perfect injustice:
and we must concede to him, that while committing the grossest acts of
injustice, he has won himself the highest reputation for justice; and
that should he make a false step, he is able to recover himself, partly by
a talent for speaking with effect, in case he be called in question for
any of his misdeeds, and partly because his courage and strength, and
his command of friends and money, enable him to employ force with
success, whenever force is required. Such being our unjust man, let
us, in pursuance of the argument, place the just man by his side, a man
of true simplicity and nobleness, resolved, as Æschylus says, not to seem,
but to be, good. We must certainly take away the seeming; for if he be
thought to be a just man, he will have honours and gifts on the strength
of this reputation, so that it will be uncertain whether it is for justice’s
sake, or for the sake of the gifts and honours, that he is what he is.
Yes; we must strip him bare of everything but justice, and make his
whole case the reverse of the former. Without being guilty of one
unjust act, let him have the worst reputation for injustice, so that his
virtue may be thoroughly tested, and shewn to be proof against infamy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>all its consequences; and let him go on till the day of his death, steadfast
in his justice, but with a lifelong reputation for injustice; in order
that, having brought both the men to the utmost limits of justice and of
injustice respectively, we may then give judgment as to which of the two
is the happier.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good heavens! my dear Glaucon,” said I, “how vigorously you
work, scouring the two characters clean for our judgment, like a pair of
statues.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I do it as well as I can,” he said. “And after describing the men
as we have done, there will be no further difficulty, I imagine, in proceeding
to sketch the kind of life which awaits them respectively. Let me therefore
describe it. And if the description be somewhat coarse, do not
regard it as mine, Socrates, but as coming from those who commend injustice
above justice. They will say that in such a situation the just man
will be scourged, racked, fettered, will have his eyes burnt out, and at
last, after suffering every kind of torture, will be crucified; and thus
learn that it is best to resolve, not to be, but to seem, just.”<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c009'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The picture of the just man here is surely a very remarkable
one. It is dramatically put into the mouth of Glaucon, and part of
it is by him attributed to those who commend injustice; but these
are but literary forms; the picture is Plato’s own. It is his ideal of
the just man; and the extraordinary thing is his belief, here stated
so plainly, that a man whose heart is perfectly set on righteousness
may be so completely misunderstood by those around him, as to
be regarded by them as utterly unjust, and may in consequence
be subjected to the extremest torture and the most shameful
death.</p>

<p class='c005'>No one can doubt that it was the death of his master that
led Plato to perceive the great truth to which he here gives such
energetic expression. The charges against Socrates were a complete
inversion of the truth: his reverence was called impiety;
his brilliant work for the character of the youth of his day brought
him the charge of baneful corruption. From his tragic end Plato
learned that the good man who brings new truth is very likely to
be completely misunderstood and to be classed with the worst
wrong-doers.</p>

  <h2 id='chap3' class='c006'>CHAPTER <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. <br> THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>The history of Israel is unique in the annals of the nations.
In size scarcely worthy of regard, in politics only for one brief reign
of any serious account, with no special genius for art or war,
for speculative thinking or scientific research, failing to keep
even their racial unity in the day of their greatest strength, torn
in pieces by every conqueror, deported out of their own land, and
even after their return kept in subjection by other imperial races,
finally stripped of their temple and sacred city by the Romans,
and shattered into fragments, this feeble people has yet set its
name high beside Greece and Rome, has given the world the only
book which all the world reads,<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c009'><sup>[139]</sup></a> and the religion which has
produced Western civilization.</p>

<p class='c005'>The one duty of which the best spirits in Israel were
conscious throughout the history of the people was faithfulness
to Jehovah. Indeed the whole consciousness of the race might
be summed up in two phrases: <i>Jehovah is the God of Israel</i>, and,
<i>Israel is the people of Jehovah</i>. War, government, philosophy,
art might be for other peoples: Israel’s one duty was to serve
her God, religion the sole activity of her spirit.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>The relation between Jehovah and Israel was a peculiarly
tender one;—“When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and
called my son out of Egypt,”<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c009'><sup>[140]</sup></a> says Jehovah by the mouth of one of
His prophets. As Israel was Jehovah’s son, he had to be
taught, trained, disciplined. The history of the people, then,
is simply the record of Jehovah’s dealings with them in this
process of loving and patient training.</p>

<p class='c005'>Israel’s education was chiefly in the hard school of experience,
in national disaster and disgrace, in national recovery and
victory. But not in events alone: Jehovah spoke His will out
clearly through a series of most remarkable men known as the
<span class='sc'>Prophets</span>. What is most noticeable in these men is the directness
and the certainty of the message they brought from Jehovah
to His people. Usually it was criticism and condemnation, with
a definite declaration of coming punishment; but now and then
it was comfort and consolation, with the promise of speedy help
and relief.</p>

<p class='c005'>It would be most interesting to trace the history in detail and
to watch how the people were led step by step to fuller and
clearer knowledge of God, but we must not stay for that here. We
need only say sufficient to enable readers to understand the circumstances
in which the great prophecy which we wish to discuss
came to be uttered.</p>

<p class='c005'>The people were slaves in Egypt. They were brought out
under Moses; and in the peninsula of Sinai a Covenant was made
between them and Jehovah, which laid the foundation of their
religion and their national life. Joshua was their leader in the
conquest of Palestine, an event which probably took place in the
thirteenth century <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> During the first two centuries of their
residence in the land they had no settled form of government,
but acknowledged as their rulers from time to time certain great
personalities known as Judges. Towards the end of the eleventh
century the pressure of the Philistines led to the establishment
of a monarchy. Saul knit the people together; David built up
a petty empire; Solomon gave his attention to commerce and
internal organization.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>But after these three reigns the nation fell in two. From
937 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> onward for two centuries, instead of one state there are
two rival kingdoms, the northern called Israel and the southern
Judah. The great events of these centuries occur in Israel.
Through the prophets Elijah and Elisha the people were taught
that Jehovah would never consent to be one among many gods:
<i>They must worship Jehovah alone</i>. Later, Amos prophesied
that Jehovah would bring about the destruction of the kingdom
of Israel, because the people would not live righteously.
They offered God sacrifices, while He demanded righteous
conduct between man and man. But they could not believe
that Jehovah would destroy His own chosen people: “How
can we believe that He will destroy the only people in all
the world that He has made Himself known to?” Swift comes
the answer, “You only have I known of all the families of
the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.”<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c009'><sup>[141]</sup></a>
Israel had had greater privileges than any other people;
therefore Israel had a deeper responsibility, and would receive
a severer punishment. In 722 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> the Assyrians overthrew
Israel, and carried away 27,290 of the leading inhabitants
and settled them in Mesopotamia and Media.<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c009'><sup>[142]</sup></a> The prophecy
of Amos was thus literally fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c005'>The kingdom of Judah, which was not involved in the fate
of Israel, stood for rather more than a century longer. Isaiah was
the prophet of Jehovah in Judah when Israel fell. He condemned
his own people just as Amos had condemned Israel, because they
identified religion with ritual, and would not give Jehovah what
He wanted, namely, righteousness. The state of the people was
so bad that Isaiah declared that nothing could cure them.
Jehovah would intervene: the bulk of the people would be destroyed,
but <i>a righteous remnant would be saved</i>. Towards
the end of Isaiah’s life Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came, devastated
the land of Judah, took many of the cities, and demanded
the surrender of the capital, Jerusalem. Isaiah advised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>the king not to yield, and prophesied that the Assyrian would
not be able to touch the city. His prophecy was fulfilled to the
letter. The huge Assyrian army was suddenly annihilated by some
unknown cause, probably pestilence, and Sennacherib hastened
back to Assyria.<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c009'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>A century later Judah was in a still worse condition: idolatry,
polytheism, immorality were eating out the vitals of the nation.
In 604 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> Jeremiah prophesied that Jehovah would bring
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, into Syria, and that he would
destroy Judah and all the nations round about, that they would
groan under the rule of Babylon for seventy years, but that at
the end of that period Jehovah would punish the Babylonians for
their iniquity, and would make their land desolate forever.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c009'><sup>[144]</sup></a> But
his countrymen would not listen. Jehovah had saved His people
from the Assyrian in the time of Isaiah: why should He allow the
Babylonian to touch them now? Yet in 585 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> Nebuchadnezzar
took Jerusalem, burned the city and the temple, and carried
away the king and all the leading families to Babylon.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c009'><sup>[145]</sup></a> Once
more the word of Jehovah, as spoken by His prophets, was literally
fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c005'>But what was to be the end?—Jehovah seemed to have utterly
destroyed His chosen people: what was His purpose? what good
was to come out of it?</p>

<p class='c005'>The people of the northern kingdom, carried away in 722
<abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>, soon lost their religion, and were in consequence speedily lost
themselves among the peoples of the East. Not so the captives of
Judah: the training of Isaiah and his disciples and of Jeremiah
and his friends had taken fast hold of their hearts, so that even in
a foreign land, far away from home and temple, they held by the
religion of Jehovah. Nor is that all: they began to take their
religion seriously; they began to perceive that the prophets were
right in declaring that Jehovah was a very different God from the
gods of the nations around them, that He would not be satisfied
with sacrifice and song, but demanded <i>heart-worship and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>righteousness</i>. But although they clung to their faith in Jehovah,
they were naturally greatly depressed by the seeming hopelessness
of their captivity.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c009'><sup>[146]</sup></a> To rebel against the Babylonians, and by the
sword regain their freedom and their land, was an utter impossibility:
they were altogether helpless under the omnipotent empire.</p>

<p class='c005'>But about 550 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> Cyrus, an Elamite king, began a great
career of conquest. In 549 he overthrew the Cimmerians under
their king Astyages, and by 546 he was master of Persia. He
then went further west to subdue Asia Minor.<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c009'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>It was at this juncture, according to all scholars, that a great
prophet, whose name is unknown, began to comfort and encourage
the Jewish exiles in Babylon. His prophecy is preserved for us
in the latter part of the book of Isaiah.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c009'><sup>[148]</sup></a> His message is that
the sufferings of the exiles are nearly at an end, that Cyrus is to
capture Babylon and give them leave to return to their native
land.<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c009'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>In 538 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> Cyrus marched into Babylonia, defeated the
Babylonian army, and seized the city, thus fulfilling in a very
striking way the second part of Jeremiah’s prophecy.<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c009'><sup>[150]</sup></a> Soon
after, the Judean captives received permission to return to
Palestine. They were also allowed to carry with them the sacred
vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple
in Jerusalem.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c009'><sup>[151]</sup></a> The prophecy of restoration was thus triumphantly
fulfilled. One company of exiles went at once, and others
followed them later.</p>

<p class='c005'>The people of Jehovah in this way began life afresh after
the great national punishment of the Captivity. They had
thoroughly learned one lesson at least, namely, this, that <i>Jehovah
spoke through His prophets</i>. So in their new system, while they
retained the old ritual of the temple, they made careful provision
for the preservation of the writings of the prophets and for the
instruction of the people in the Mosaic Law.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>We need trace the history no farther; for it was this post-exilic
Judaism, with its great care for the Scriptures, and its
energetic attempts to instil them into the minds of the people,
that formed the environment of Jesus and His work.</p>

<p class='c005'>But we must now return to the great prophet who spoke
consolation to the exiles in Babylon, and study his ideas. His
conception of God is very lofty. He illustrates in many ways His
holiness, His faithfulness, His tender sympathy, His omnipotence,
His absolute sway among nations, and His power of foretelling
future events by the mouth of His prophets. On the other hand,
the prophet’s conception of the duty and destiny of the people of
Jehovah is correspondingly high. Israel has been created and
chosen by Jehovah, and therefore is precious in His sight; but
He did not choose them out of favouritism, nor was it His purpose
to heap blessings on them merely for their pleasure and aggrandizement.
Israel is <i>the Servant of Jehovah</i>. The service they
have to render is to reveal God’s character and purposes to all the
nations of the earth. This is the end of their election and of their
long training. But, as in the past the nation has fallen far short of
Jehovah’s ideal, so now in Babylon the people as a whole is very far
from fit for the work which God has for them to do: “Who is
blind but my servant? or deaf as my messenger that I send?”<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c009'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Consequently there is a further choice within the chosen
people. The use of the title, the Servant of Jehovah, is narrowed.
The prophet knows that God’s ends will be worked out, that
through Israel Jehovah’s name will be carried to the ends of the
earth; he also sees as clearly that the nation as a nation is
unfit for this lofty duty; so he recognises that the Servant who shall
do this work will be found within the people. Whether he
identified the Servant of Jehovah in this narrower sense with the
small group of really God-fearing men who formed the soul of
Israel in his own day, or whether he thought of an individual to
be specially prepared for the task by Jehovah, we do not know.
Most probably this point was not clear to the prophet himself.<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c009'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>It is in four poems of peculiar dignity and surpassing
spiritual penetration that this narrower use of the title occurs. In
the first<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c009'><sup>[154]</sup></a> of these Jehovah describes His Servant’s character and
work; in the second<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c009'><sup>[155]</sup></a>, the Servant tells how Jehovah prepared
him for his task; in the third,<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c009'><sup>[156]</sup></a> we have a portrait of the Servant
as a martyr; while in the fourth<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c009'><sup>[157]</sup></a>, he is represented, though
righteous himself, as dying a shameful death as an atonement for
the sins of the unrighteous. It is to this fourth poem that we
would direct the attention of our readers.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In this marvellous poem we have four successive vignettes
of the Servant. There first rises in the prophet’s mind a vision of
the awe-struck wonder with which the nations and their kings
shall gaze on the Servant of Jehovah, when after unequalled
humiliation he shall be uplifted in surpassing glory. The next
picture takes us back to his life of humiliation: he grows up with
nothing in him to strike the eye or attract the attention of men;
nay, rather all turn their back on him as worthless, contemptible,
smitten with divine punishment. But along with this
sorrowful portrait there comes the passionate confession of the
men of Israel, that the Servant in all his sufferings had been
bearing their sins. The third picture shows us the suffering
Servant in uncomplaining meekness enduring a criminal’s death
with all its shameful associations; yet this death is explained as
occurring in accordance with God’s will, and as being a guilt-offering.
The series ends in triumph: the righteous Servant by
bearing iniquity will make many righteous and will achieve the
glory and the reward of the conqueror.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this prophecy the remarkable thing is that the sufferings and
death of the Servant are construed throughout, not as a martyrdom,
but as much more. In his death he lays down his life as a guilt-offering;
and all his sufferings, inclusive of his death, are, from
Jehovah’s point of view, chastisement laid on him on account of
the sins of others, from the Servant’s point of view, a voluntary
bearing of their iniquities. His willingness to endure and his
meekness under oppression are very vividly put before us; but
God’s purpose to crush him is insisted on with equal emphasis.
The awful tragedy happens within Israel; but after it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>consummated, the Servant, once so despised, neglected and oppressed,
startles the nations, and kings in amazement shut their
mouths in his presence. The purpose of the dread sacrifice is
<span class='fss'>TO BRING MEN TO RIGHTEOUSNESS</span>; and that end, we are told,
will be widely accomplished.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whence did the prophet draw the ideas of his prophecy? If
any piece of literature bears signs of inspiration, this does; but the
experience which enabled him to become the vehicle of inspiration
in this particular case may also be conjectured. The sufferings,
which many of the prophets, and especially Jeremiah, had
endured at the hands of their fellow-countrymen, had made a
profound impression upon the best minds in Israel; and the
affliction of the exiles in Babylon was manifestly not merely
penal, but also purificatory.</p>

</div>
<p class='c007'>The slow but steady rise of an obscure inland Italian town, first
to the rule of all Italy, and finally to imperial sway over the whole
Mediterranean world, is as full of problems for the intellect as of
fascination for the imagination. Whence the extraordinary vigour
and practical genius of this city? What gave it so much capacity
in comparison with any other Italian town? Does the secret lie
in the Roman character, the Roman intellect, or in the constitution
of the republican city itself? But other questions still more serious
press for answers: How did the Roman government affect the
subject provinces? How did it react upon the Roman character
and upon the life of the capital? Could a single city furnish men
of character and ability in sufficient numbers for such a prodigious
task?</p>

<p class='c005'>The answer to these grave questions must be sought in the
history of the last century of the existence of the republic. From
about 145 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> to about 48 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> Rome was never at rest: violent
political strife, faction, proscriptions and civil wars eclipse everything
else in the internal history of the imperial city during these
years. The old state machinery was getting worn out; the old
families, corrupted by the immeasurable success of the Rome
which was their making, were grinding the provinces by their
cruelty and greed, and would not budge an inch from their privileges,
nor indeed lift a finger, to save Rome and Italy from the
moral and economic ruin with which they were threatened. The
wrongs of the slave, the Italian and the provincial cried aloud for
redress; scarcely less urgent was the need for the introduction
of a great deal of fresh blood into the governing classes; but
the latter were bitterly hostile to every change. Hence the violent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>struggles throughout the century between the Government and
the other classes. The empire had proved too much for the old
Roman character.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c009'><sup>[158]</sup></a> The only force that remained really efficient
was the army.</p>

<p class='c005'>Who shall describe the ruin, bloodshed, misery, desolation,
wrought by these years? The national character suffered a frightful
fall also: corruption in public, immorality in private, became
all but universal. The weariness and the hopelessness generated
by the seemingly unending strife made men forget their old
passion for freedom and sigh even for tyranny, if only it would
bring peace.</p>

<p class='c005'>Relief came when Julius Cæsar crushed Pompey at Pharsalus
in <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> 48. There was fighting here and there for two years
more, but it was of little consequence. Pharsalus made Cæsar
the monarch of Rome. He lived barely four years after his
victory; for the daggers of the conspirators found his heart on the
<abbr title='fifteenth'>15th</abbr> of March, 44 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>; yet by a series of masterly administrative
and legislative acts he laid in great broad lines the foundation of
the new empire and set in motion the healthy forces that were
needed for the regeneration of Rome and Italy. His work is
Titanic both in conception and execution. Seldom has such a
great man executed such a mighty task.</p>

<p class='c005'>But his murder loosed all the old fiends again, and they
worked wilder woe than ever. For now the whole gigantic empire
was drawn into the whirlpool, and the provinces were only a little
less miserable than Italy. During Cæsar’s own struggle his
mighty genius and his magnanimity had thrown a glory upon the
murky clouds of the storm; but now that the sun was set, black
darkness settled over the unhappy empire.<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c009'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>There was a pause in the strife, when, in <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> 40, a treaty
was drawn up between Octavian and Antony at Brundisium and
confirmed by the marriage of Antony to the sister of Octavian.
Men hoped that the end had come at last and that the world
would enjoy a lasting peace.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>It was during this bright moment that Virgil, who later was
to write the <i>Aeneid</i>, and so earn for himself a very great name in
European literature, composed a short poem, which finds a place
among his Pastorals, and is named <i>Pollio</i>. Here is a translation
of lines four to twenty-five, which will be found quite sufficient to
bring the main ideas of the poem before us:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The last epoch of the Sybil’s prophecy has come at length; the great
series of the ages is being born anew; at length the virgin, Justice, is returning,
returning too the reign of Saturn; at length a new race of men is being
sent down from heaven high. Do thou, Lucina, but smile thy chaste smile
upon a boy with whose coming at last ceases the iron race and the golden
springs up throughout the world; do so, Lucina: it is thine own Apollo that
now reigns. It is in thy consulship, Pollio, that this glorious age will come
in, and the months of the great year will begin their march. Under thy
leadership all traces that remain of Roman crime in civil strife shall pass
away, and passing, free the lands from constant fear.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He shall receive the life of the gods, and shall behold gods and heroes
mingling together; and himself shall be beheld by them; and with his father’s
virtues he shall rule the world at peace.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Unasked the earth shall shower upon thee, sweet boy, thy first baby
gifts, the gadding ivy with the fox-glove, and lily-bean entwined with smiling
bear’s-foot. The goats shall bring home uncalled their milk-filled udders;
the harts shall no longer fear great lions; and flowers shall spring to caress
thee where’er thou liest down. The asp shall perish; the treacherous, poison
herb shall perish too; and everywhere shall spring Assyrian balm.”<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c009'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>The Greeks and Romans had a great system of cycles and
ages, not unlike the Hindu Kalpas and Manvantaras. One cycle
follows another, the beginning of each being marked by the sun,
moon and stars all occupying their original positions. The
Roman phrase for cycle is “great year.” Each great year is subdivided
into “months,” that is ages. The first age of each great
year is the golden, when Saturn reigns, and a divine race of men
occupies the earth; the last is the iron age, when Apollo reigns,
and men are sinful.</p>

<p class='c005'>Virgil declares, then, that the end of the old cycle has come,
and that the new cycle is about to begin with all the splendour of
the golden age. Saturn will reign; Justice and Peace will return
to the earth; a god-like race of men will spring up all over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>world; nature will be redeemed; and primitive simplicity and
innocence will reappear. Idyllic scenes of peace and plenty—trade
and manufacture all forgotten—give the poem a wonderful
charm.</p>

<p class='c005'>The most outstanding idea of the prophecy, however, is that
the new age opens with the birth of a boy, who is to receive
special divine help, and is to be at once the pattern and the prince
of the new time. Who the boy was that Virgil had in mind, the
critics have not been able to decide.<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c009'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Clearly he was a son born
in 40 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> to one of the leading Romans; but we can say no
more. Evidently Virgil believed that the civil wars were over,
that a new era of peace had begun, and that this boy might be
looked forward to as the ruler who should effectively transform
the empire, revive primitive virtue and simplicity, and banish the
foul demon war forever.</p>

<p class='c005'>His prediction was not verified: no boy born in 40 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>
became a world-ruler and regenerator; and, besides, nine long
years of doubt and fear, horror and blood, had to be endured,
before Octavian became, by the battle of Actium, the acknowledged
master of the Roman world; and, while he completed the task
of Cæsar, and succeeded in doing the work of a great ruler in a
marvellous fashion, no one would dream of saying that he fulfilled
the ideal of this poem.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is an unfulfilled prophecy; yet it is not without interest
and value for men to-day. First of all it is of interest as a revelation
of the ideas and the hopes that filled men’s minds in
Virgil’s time. “The anticipation of a new era was widely spread
and vividly felt over the world; and this anticipation—the state
of men’s minds at and subsequent to the time when this poem
was written—probably contributed to the acceptance of the great
political and spiritual changes which awaited the world.”<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c009'><sup>[162]</sup></a> But it
is of still greater interest as a revelation of what Virgil himself
thought, Virgil, who was perhaps the purest and most interesting
personality in the Græco-Roman world then. Men generally
were looking for a regeneration of the world; we have here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Virgil’s own thoughts on the great subject. He shared with
others the idea that the world was on the verge of the dawning of
a new day, a day of renewed justice and peace; but he had an
idea of his own, that of a great personality, a man of high moral
character, specially endowed by the gods for his great task as
leader and ruler of the new time. Scarcely less prominent is his
idea of the nobler race of men that shall spring up in the new
era. It is no picture merely of good government such as
Augustus gave the world that we have here; but a prophecy of
the moral regeneration of mankind under the influence of a
divinely prepared leader.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. The difference between ancient and modern times in
Europe is vital. Human society is never stagnant; development
in one direction or another is constant; so that in the course of a
few centuries changes, both numerous and noticeable, take place
everywhere. Thus the Europe of the middle ages differs very
markedly from the Europe of to-day. Yet the one is the direct
outcome of the other. On the other hand, the civilizations of
Greece and Rome, although we owe them an incalculable debt, are
marked off from modern civilization by differences which can only
be spoken of as essential. For it is not any single element that
has been added externally to ancient life so as to produce modern
society; it is rather a subtle spirit, which has modified all thinking,
altered the values of things, produced organic changes in
government and society, and recreated art and literature. The
unexampled development of science and invention, and the
extraordinary activity and vigour of European commerce and arms,
which are often spoken of as the chief characteristics of modern
civilization, are rather to be regarded as indications of unparalleled
vitality and efficiency in the social organism than as essential
products of its spirit. Science and invention flourished among
the Greeks; the Roman empire was as vigorous as any modern
state in matters of war. These things prove the healthy vitality
of the society of the West; its essential spirit is to be sought
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c005'>A comparison of ancient and modern life reveals differences
at once very numerous and greatly significant. The economics
of Europe have been revolutionized; for the labour, the manufacture
and the commerce of ancient times rested on a basis of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>slavery.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c009'><sup>[163]</sup></a> Government has been turned upside down; for the ruling
principle of ancient politics was hereditary and exclusive citizenship
in a city-state;<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c009'><sup>[164]</sup></a> while modern politics have been created by
the great principles of the equality of men irrespective of birth
or station and the indefeasible sovereignty of the people.<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c009'><sup>[165]</sup></a> In
ancient society human life as such had no value: infanticide was
practised openly by all as a right and proper thing necessary for
the well-being of the family and the state;<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c009'><sup>[166]</sup></a> prisoners taken in
war, if not killed, were made slaves, and as slaves their lives and
persons were absolutely at the mercy of their masters;<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c009'><sup>[167]</sup></a> aliens
had a place in the state only on sufferance: society stood in no
relation to them and had no duties towards them.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c009'><sup>[168]</sup></a> The social
organism of modern times, on the other hand, is a new creation,
produced by the conception of the inherent sanctity of human
life and the divine dignity of the human personality.<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c009'><sup>[169]</sup></a> Modern
education is in form and method Greek; but the results it
produces are altogether new; first, because it carries the modern
spirit within the ancient forms, and secondly, because modern men
regard education as part of the birthright of every human being.
Moral ideals show very important differences, chiefly in the
direction of the elevation of humility, meekness, sympathy,
forgiveness and self-sacrifice, and the extraordinary advance in the
conception of the right of individual freedom. In ancient times
the individual citizen had no rights as against the State;<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c009'><sup>[170]</sup></a> now we
demand not only freedom in matters of profession and business,
as against caste restrictions, but intellectual, moral and religious
liberty. The differences between ancient and modern
religion are very extraordinary in many ways. For the present
we need only note the one far-reaching distinction, that to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>ancients religion was a <i>political duty</i>, which the citizen was
bound to fulfil, and a <i>civic privilege</i>, which only those in whose
veins ran the sacred blood of the community could share;<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c009'><sup>[171]</sup></a>
while modern religion is the loftiest activity of the human spirit,
as far transcending the narrow limits of the State as it does the
petty distinctions of race and blood. The differences, then,
between ancient and modern life are not accidental but essential.</p>

<p class='c005'>A second thing to be noticed is the altogether unexampled
vitality and pervasiveness of modern civilization. During the
nineteenth century alone, while the population of the rest of the
world remained nearly stationary, the actual numbers of the
European peoples rose from 170,000,000 to 500,000,000.<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c009'><sup>[172]</sup></a> Here
is physical life on a gigantic scale. Let readers think, next, of
the extraordinary advances made during the nineteenth century
in every province of natural science, from mathematics and
physics up through the biological sciences to psychology and
the science of religion, the swift upward progress made in literary,
historical and philosophical method, and the innumerable inventions
that have been produced for facilitating every form of human
activity. Are not these facts evidence of an amazing store of intellectual
vitality in the society of the West? Think also of the
buoyancy, the hope, the youthful delight in action, the glance
into the future, which characterize the progressive peoples of
Europe and America. Colonization, on the other hand, exploration,
missions, world-wide commerce, domination over other races,
whether you call them bad or good, are incontestable proofs of
energy, physical, moral and intellectual. Further, these forms
of vital force are clearly of the greatest practical importance in
the world. In the process of natural selection which, whether we
like it or not, is ceaselessly being carried on among the races
of mankind, the possession of such energy is one of the crucial
factors in the struggle. But this civilization has also an altogether
unique power of entering into other civilizations and working
revolutionary changes there: its pervasiveness is almost as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>remarkable as its vitality. We need only point to India and
Japan to-day for proof of this.</p>

<p class='c005'>Western civilization, then, is a thing by itself, not more
clearly distinguished from ancient life than from the civilizations
that have arisen in other parts of the world. What is it that has
made the difference? What subtle spirit is it that appears in
every aspect of the civilization, that assumes so many forms, and
generates such transcending energies?</p>

<p class='c005'>There can be but one answer: it is Christianity. In every
community religion is the life principle, the central fire, which
fills the whole with living force, and communicates its own spirit
to every cell of the organism.<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c009'><sup>[173]</sup></a> That is a law which is becoming
ever more apparent in all anthropological, sociological and
religious science. From this general law we might conclude in
this particular case, that it is the religion that gives the civilization
its character. But we need not appeal to general principles;
history tells us in the clearest tones that the peculiarities which
distinguish Western civilization from every other spring directly
or indirectly from the Christian faith.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now one way of classifying religions is to divide them into
two groups, spontaneous and founded. The former are results of
the united unconscious action of a tribe or people: for example,
the religions of Greece and Rome. The latter spring from some
particular man, and are inseparably connected with his life: for
example, Buddhism, Christianity and Mohammedanism.</p>

<p class='c005'>That Christianity is a founded religion, and that it springs
from Christ, admits of no question. Tacitus, the Roman historian,
in speaking of the great fire at Rome in 64 <abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr>, which devastated
ten of the fourteen districts into which the Imperial city was divided,
says that the people got their heads filled with the suspicion,
that the Emperor himself (Nero was then on the throne) had used
his agents to set the city on fire. He then continues:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and
inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations,
called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its
origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the
hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea,
the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and
shameful from every part of the world find their centre and become popular.
Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who pleaded guilty; then, upon
their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the
crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort
was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn
by dogs and perished; or were nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames
and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight had expired.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Nero offered his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in
the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or
stood aloft on a car. Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and
exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not,
as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man’s cruelty, that they
were being destroyed.”<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c009'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>Christ, then, is a historical person. He was a Jew; He
founded Christianity; and He was executed by Pontius Pilatus
during his procuratorship of Judæa, <i><abbr class='spell'>i.e.</abbr></i>, between 27 and 37
<abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr><a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c009'><sup>[175]</sup></a> Other facts enable scholars to fix the date of His death
within narrower limits: a few adopt 30 <abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr>, but by far the
greatest number prefer 29 <abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr>;<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c009'><sup>[176]</sup></a> and that date we adopt here.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, then, are the facts: Christ was put to death by the
Roman Governor of Judæa in 29 <abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr>, but this did not extinguish
Christianity; for it spread not only in Judæa but beyond; so
much so, that in 64 <abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr> “an immense multitude” of Christians
were found in Rome, and were for their faith put to death with
horrible barbarities.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such is the first chapter of the history of Christianity in
Europe. From this point onwards the facts are well known.
The furious hostility visible here in the spirit of the Roman
Empire against the Christian faith ended in the victory of the
latter, in its gradual acceptance by the races of Europe, and the
continuously increasing infiltration of Christian ideas into the
minds of the people. The process is far from complete; for the
contrast between the old spirit and the new is so extreme that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>only long ages of discipline and the slow processes of evolution
will suffice to work the transformation. We have seen how
essentially different the spirit in our modern life is from the spirit
of Græco-Roman life: how much greater would be the contrast,
if one were to oppose the pure spirit of Christ to the spirit of
Paganism! When men accept Christ, they are conscious of the
authority of His perfect character and His heavenly life, and they
know that He claims their complete submission to Him; but
they have no idea how far-reaching this claim is. Christ demands
that not only every part of the individual’s life—thoughts, feelings,
words, deeds—but every aspect of social and political life as well
should be made subject to His law of love. This is easily stated:
how hard is it to work it out, except in a long series of generations!</p>

<p class='c005'>But imperfect as has been the perception of Christ’s aims,
and still more imperfect the execution of these by the peoples of
Europe, yet the results of even their very partial submission to them
have been, as we have seen, momentous in the highest degree.
Christ has made modern Europe.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now we found from our study of Virgil’s prophecy that he
believed that a new age was just about to open. Like other
thinking men of his day, he felt that the civilization under which he
lived was played out, that new life was needed, new morals and a
fresh organization of society. He believed that in the new age the
leader and king would be a great Roman, and that under him the
world would be transformed.</p>

<p class='c005'>Further, it is sufficiently striking that, while his prophecy
received no literal fulfilment, yet the new age did actually begin
shortly after the time when he wrote, an age which has produced
a new race of men, new moral ideas and an altogether fresh
organization of society, and vitality and virility, besides, such as
Virgil never dreamed of. He spoke of a great leader favoured of
the gods, a noble Roman. The new age did come in under the
guidance of a new leader, but he was no aristocratic Roman, but
a Jew, and a man of the people, Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c005'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Christ’s name and life are well-known outside Christendom.
He is spoken of in very high terms in the book which all
Mohammedans revere; and contact with the West has brought a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>certain amount of knowledge about him to the peoples of India,
China and Japan. Now the most striking fact in this connection is
this, that while most of these Mohammedans, Hindus, Buddhists,
and Confucians condemn Christians violently, and many write
against Christianity, <i>they one and all speak with the highest praise
of the character of Christ</i>. The same is true of sceptics and agnostics
in Christian lands. One might compile a most fascinating
volume consisting merely of extracts from non-Christian writers,
in which Christ is spoken of as the best of men, as the ideal man,
as the man whom all men should not only admire, but imitate.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now we have in this a most remarkable fact. There is no
other character in history that is so universally revered. There is
no other man whom all men join in praising with so much heartiness.
Charles Lamb speaks for the human race when he says:
“If Shakespeare were to enter this room, we should all spring to
our feet; if Christ were to enter, we should all fall on our knees.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But <span class='fss'>HE WAS CRUCIFIED</span>. This, the purest and noblest
of men, was subjected to the most shameful form of death possible.
Nor was there only the bare execution: every circumstance that
could make death bitter to the noble human spirit was added. He
was betrayed by one of His own chosen Twelve; the remaining
eleven deserted Him; one plucked up heart and followed at a distance,
but only to deny him. Indeed the universal breakdown of
human character around Him is one of the saddest things in history.
The Jewish priests and scribes, the common people, the Roman
Governor and the common soldiers, all reveal their worst passions
in the presence of Christ, while He stands amongst them in all the
silent majesty of innocence.<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c009'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>We here quote three short paragraphs from <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Matthew’s
Gospel.<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c009'><sup>[178]</sup></a> The first describes what took place after the members
of the Jewish Sanhedrin had decided that Jesus deserved to be put
to death:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then did they spit in His face, and buffet Him; and some smote Him
with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us, Thou Christ: who
is he that struck Thee?”<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c009'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Then those model judges carried their prisoner before Pontius
Pilate, the Roman Governor, and after much persuasion got him
to condemn Jesus to death, when the following scenes took
place:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus into the palace, and
gathered unto Him the whole band. And they stripped Him, and put on Him
a scarlet robe. And they plaited a crown of thorns and put it upon His head,
and a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled down before Him, and
mocked Him, saying, ‘Hail, King of the Jews!’ And they spat upon Him,
and took the reed and smote Him on the head. And when they had mocked
Him, they took off from Him the robe, and put on Him His garments and
led Him away to crucify Him.”<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c009'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>“And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name;
him they compelled to go with them, that he might bear His cross. And
when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place
of a skull, they gave Him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when He had
tasted it, He would not drink. And when they had crucified Him, they parted
His garments among them, casting lots: and they sat and watched Him
there. And they set up over His head His accusation written, THIS IS
JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then are there crucified with Him
two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on the left. And they that
passed by railed on Him, wagging their heads, and saying, ‘Thou that
destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days, save Thyself: if Thou art
the Son of God, come down from the cross.’ In like manner also the chief
priests mocking Him with the scribes and elders said, ‘He saved others:
Himself He cannot save. He is the King of Israel; let Him now come down
from the cross, and we will believe on Him. He trusteth on God; let Him
deliver Him now, if He desireth Him: for He said, I am the Son of God.’
And the robbers also that were crucified with Him cast upon Him the same
reproach.”<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c009'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'>How was it that of all men Jesus should be the man subjected
to all this? How can we reconcile His character and His
destiny?</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us recollect what Plato had written 400 years earlier:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The just man will be scourged, racked, fettered, will have his eyes
burned out, and at last, after suffering every kind of torture, will be
crucified.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Now we do not insist on the correspondence in detail between
the words of Plato and the death of Christ, although that, while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>not complete, is sufficiently remarkable; but we wish to emphasize,
with all possible force, this most extraordinary fact,
that Plato foresaw that a man of the character of Jesus would
suffer as He did.</p>

<p class='c005'>How are we to explain the fact? What is the reason why
the men of Christ’s day treated this most humane of men with
such barbarous inhumanity? The answer is that it was inevitable.
Jesus is the revelation of the uttermost holiness of God, and <i>His
attempt to lay that standard upon the human spirit</i><a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c009'><sup>[182]</sup></a> roused to its
utmost fury against Him all the sinfulness of our common human
nature. It is the same contest of which we are each conscious
in our daily life between inclination and conscience; only, in the
case of Jesus, it seems as if all the little battles of every individual
life had met in one gigantic struggle between sinful human
nature and its Lord. And the same struggle necessarily continues
wherever Christianity goes. The persecutions of the Roman
Empire are merely the external signs of the convulsive efforts of
the spirit of Paganism to resist the march of the Spirit of God.
In every land Christ is met by the same opposition. Everywhere
selfishness, self-interest and passion dissuade men from following
the Man of Sorrows; and the struggle is there, terrible in its
reality and intensity, even if it never break out into open persecution.
But, in surveying these surging battles, the careful observer is
much struck with this fact, that, while human passions inevitably
fight against Christ, yet He has in Conscience an ally, which neither
by bribes nor by bullying can be made to desert Him. He is
the objective conscience of the human race. He is Plato’s just
man.</p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c005'><abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Let us now try to realize what kind of a being the
founder of Christianity was. Our chief sources of information
are the Gospels; for from the other books of the New Testament
and from outside literature we learn only scattered facts about
His life on earth. We shall not appeal to the fourth Gospel, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>there are still numerous questions with regard to it unsettled, but
shall confine ourselves to Matthew, Mark and Luke, books recognized
on all hands as of high historical value, and as having
been written between 65 and 95 <abbr class='spell'>A.D.</abbr><a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c009'><sup>[183]</sup></a> Anyone may very speedily
convince himself of the splendid historical reliability of these
simple narratives. From Josephus and other Jewish writers of the
first and second centuries, and from casual remarks in Greek and
Roman books, we are able to learn what the life of these days
was like;<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c009'><sup>[184]</sup></a> but nowhere do we get such vivid, detailed, realistic
pictures as in the Gospels. “They are full of feeling for the
time; they understand its men, schools, classes, parties; they
know the thoughts that are in the air, the rumours that run along
the street; they are familiar with the catchwords and phrases of the
period, its conventions, questions, modes of discussion and style
of argument. And all is presented with the utmost realism, so
grouped round the central figure as to form a perfect historical
picture, He and His setting being so built together as to constitute
a single organic whole.”<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c009'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>How then does Christ appear in them?—His name was Jesus;<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c009'><sup>[186]</sup></a>
Christ is a title springing from his teaching, as we shall see. He
lived in the small town of Nazareth, in the district of Galilee<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c009'><sup>[187]</sup></a> in
Palestine, and worked as a carpenter there.<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c009'><sup>[188]</sup></a> At length, in 26 <abbr class='spell'>A.D.</abbr>,
He gave up carpentry and began His public career as a preacher.<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c009'><sup>[189]</sup></a>
The picture given of Him in the Gospels is a most attractive
one. Wherever He goes, the sick, the suffering, the distressed
crowd around Him. Blind beggars, outcast lepers, hopeless
paralytics, even uncontrollable lunatics, receive help from His
healing power. He feeds the hungry, breathes hope into the
downcast, lifts up the enfeebled patient, helps the helpless. But
while every form of suffering and sorrow appeals to His compassion,
His heart is set on winning the souls of men. So we
find Him preaching in the synagogue and by the sea, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>mountain-side and in the busy street, now stirring vast crowds,
now dealing with an individual, and again pouring His rich
teaching into the ears of the chosen Twelve. No man ever had
such power of convincing men of sin and leading them to repentance:
the simple fisherman,<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c009'><sup>[190]</sup></a> the fallen woman,<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c009'><sup>[191]</sup></a> the wealthy
custom-house officer<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c009'><sup>[192]</sup></a> and the dying robber,<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c009'><sup>[193]</sup></a> all felt condemned
in His presence, and through Him entered into the new life.</p>

<p class='c005'>The character revealed in His words and deeds is beautiful
beyond comparison. The most outstanding feature of it is His
love for God and the perfect and unbroken serenity of His
intercourse with Him. Love for man also shines out everywhere.
But the most extraordinary point is this, that He in whom the
moral ideal was so lofty, so deep and so broad, He who was so
keenly conscious of sin in others, and had such power to make
them feel it, betrays absolutely no consciousness of sin Himself,
never asks for pardon, and never speaks of having repented,
or of having passed through any crisis of the nature of
conversion.<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c009'><sup>[194]</sup></a> On the other hand the perfect balance of His
character is almost as marvellous as His sinlessness: judicial
severity controlled by perfect love; supreme authority that is also
supreme gentleness; strength filled with tenderness; regal dignity
shown in acts of lowliest service; holiness that led Him among the
unholy;(sublimest self-consciousness, never leading to anything
but self-effacement and self-sacrifice.) And yet again, is there
anything about Him so wonderful as His power of winning human
love? The Gospels are full of instances of it, and to-day how
many millions of men, women and children would count it a
supreme joy to die for His sake!</p>

<p class='c005'>His teaching is a perfectly articulated and unified whole, as
may be seen from the scientific studies of it that have been published
during the last twenty years.<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c009'><sup>[195]</sup></a> But we must not attempt to
deal with that fascinating subject here, except in so far as the
whole is implied in what He says about Himself. For it is only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>that part of it, namely, His account of Himself and His mission,
that we propose to touch on.</p>

<p class='c005'>We shall understand it best, if we begin with what happened
at His crucifixion; for it was only at the end of His life that He
made perfectly clear to the whole world what His claims were.
People often wondered whether He were not THE CHRIST,
<i><abbr class='spell'>i.e.</abbr></i>, <i>The Messiah</i>, the Anointed One, the great national deliverer
whom the Jews were so earnestly expecting and praying for;<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c009'><sup>[196]</sup></a>
but during the three years of His public life He seldom openly
made the claim.<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c009'><sup>[197]</sup></a> When, however, He went to Jerusalem for the
last time, He made a royal entry into the sacred city,<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c009'><sup>[198]</sup></a> cleansed
the Temple from the desecration of its cattle-market,<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c009'><sup>[199]</sup></a> and began
to teach in the Temple courts,<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c009'><sup>[200]</sup></a> thus by both word and act
publicly claiming recognition as the Christ.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Jewish leaders had been often bitterly incensed by His
teaching and His actions before. His bold seizure of authority
now decided them: they resolved on His death.<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c009'><sup>[201]</sup></a> He was apprehended<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c009'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
and brought before the Sanhedrin,<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c009'><sup>[203]</sup></a> <i><abbr class='spell'>i.e.</abbr></i>, the High
Court of Judæa. Evidence was led against Him, but it proved very
unsubstantial;<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c009'><sup>[204]</sup></a> so the High Priest, the president of the court,
formally asked Him, “Art thou the Christ, the Son of God?”
and He answered in the affirmative.<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c009'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Since they did not believe
His claim, they could only come to the conclusion that He was
an irreligious impostor, impiously arrogating divine authority to
Himself. Consequently they declared that He ought to be put
to death for blasphemy against God.<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c009'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>But the Sanhedrin could not put anyone to death; the sanction
of the Roman Governor was necessary.<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c009'><sup>[207]</sup></a> He was therefore
dragged before Pilate. Here they did not charge Him with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>blasphemy, but with rebellion against the Roman Emperor. ‘The
King of the Jews’ was a synonym for ‘the Christ’; so they argued
that Jesus, in claiming to be the Christ, claimed the sovereignty
of the Jews, and was therefore guilty of rebellion against Tiberius.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c009'><sup>[208]</sup></a>
Pilate knew perfectly well that the Jewish leaders were jealous of
Jesus, and that the charge was a mere pretence;<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c009'><sup>[209]</sup></a> his Roman
sense of justice revolted against the execution of an innocent man;
and he wished to save Him; but they played upon his fears, and
finally succeeded in wringing a condemnation from him.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c009'><sup>[210]</sup></a> It was
because the Roman soldiers were struck with the extreme absurdity
of the idea of Jesus being a rival of Tiberius, that they got
up their pitiable comedy of a court, and did Him mock homage
as King of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c005'>So He was led away to Calvary and crucified, and above His
head on the cross was written, in three languages (Hebrew, Greek
and Latin), the charge against Him,—</p>

<p class='c013'>JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus Jesus took good care that there should be no doubt as
to what He claimed to be: He did not write a book, nor cut an
inscription on a rock, <i>but He let Himself be crucified</i>, that all men
to the end of time might know that He claimed to be the Christ.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c009'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<hr class='c010'>

<p class='c005'>Now let us see what He meant when He called Himself the
Christ. To get to understand this fully would be to learn the
complete meaning of His teaching; for it is such a perfect organism
that every member of it is closely related to every other
member; yet we may gain sufficient insight for our purpose from
a broad survey.</p>

<p class='c005'>The subject of the whole teaching of Jesus was <i>the Kingdom
of God</i>. He held that God had been working from the very
beginning for the winning of man to Himself, and that especially
among His own people Israel He had shown His hand.
They had not only come to know Him as the God of righteousness
whose law was holiness; they had enjoyed His love;
they had experienced His mercy and His power to redeem. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>with the coming of Jesus Himself a new era of the world had
opened:<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c009'><sup>[212]</sup></a> God was now drawing near to all men, in a new relationship
of love and mercy, with the purpose of saving them.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c009'><sup>[213]</sup></a>
This was the coming of the Kingdom of God.<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c009'><sup>[214]</sup></a> The history of
Israel had been a long discipline in preparation for this.<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c009'><sup>[215]</sup></a> On the
ground cleared in Israel, and on the basis of the revelation already
made to them, God would now reveal Himself to all men. The
destiny of Israel—“I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles”<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c009'><sup>[216]</sup></a>—would
now be fulfilled.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c009'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>God, then, was about to enter into a new relationship with the
whole human race. That new relationship would be, like the
old one with Israel, characterized not only by His righteousness,
but by His redeeming love. His eternal purpose, which had been
in contemplation all through the centuries of Israel’s training, would
now be unfolded. The childhood of the world was over: its first
simple lessons had been learned; the real business of Time could
now be begun. The partial unveiling of God’s face which it had
been Israel’s privilege to behold would now become a full revelation
in the sight of the nations. The King of Israel would be seen
to be the Father of men. Further, as Israel had learned her
lessons through Jehovah’s redemptive acts at the Red Sea, on
Zion, and in Babylon, so mankind would learn the Father’s love
through the great redemptive acts involved in the coming of the
Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c005'>The chief conviction that Jesus had about Himself was that
<i>in and through and by Him the Kingdom of God was coming</i>:
this it was that constituted Him THE CHRIST. His self-consciousness
is the most marvellous phenomenon within the compass
of history; there is nothing else comparable with it. The
primary element in it seems to have been the knowledge that He
was the true man, man as God wishes Him to be, faultless both
morally and religiously.<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c009'><sup>[218]</sup></a> Closely connected with this is another
element, quite as unparalleled in human experience, a feeling of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>close kinship to all men, a consciousness of solidarity with the
whole race and of personal connection and sympathy with every
individual.<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c009'><sup>[219]</sup></a> These two elements of His nature—His perfection as
man, and His relationship to the race as a whole—He summed up in
the phrase which He used so often to describe Himself, THE SON
OF MAN.<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c009'><sup>[220]</sup></a> Correspondent to this double relationship to man
stands a double relationship to God: first, He stands in the closest
personal kinship to God—the Son with the Father—; so that He
alone can reveal God, and God alone can reveal Him;<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c009'><sup>[221]</sup></a> and
secondly, He is God’s representative to the human race.<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c009'><sup>[222]</sup></a> This
dual relation to God He expressed by calling Himself THE SON
OF GOD.<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c009'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>The life of a being of this order, standing in great, pregnant
relations to God on the one hand and to the human family on
the other, would necessarily be of transcendent significance. So
we find that He regarded His own words and acts and all the
great experiences of His life as of supreme importance in the
history of the world:<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c009'><sup>[224]</sup></a> His coming opens a new era;<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c009'><sup>[225]</sup></a> His public
life is a wedding feast in the otherwise grey experience of men;<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c009'><sup>[226]</sup></a>
His teaching is the final revelation of God;<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c009'><sup>[227]</sup></a> His acts are glimpses
of the divine activity;<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c009'><sup>[228]</sup></a> His death, which to the casual observer is
but a coarse judicial murder, is the solemn sacrifice that ratifies the
establishment of the new relationship between God and man.<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c009'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Since such were the chief convictions Jesus held about
Himself and His mission, <i>authority</i> was naturally the chief note
of His teaching. His hearers marked that characteristic at the
very outset;<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c009'><sup>[230]</sup></a> and a modern student cannot fail to be impressed
with it as he reads the Gospels. He states quite frankly that
He has come to fulfil the law and the prophets;<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c009'><sup>[231]</sup></a> He sets up His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>own “I say unto you” not only against the Jewish traditions,<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c009'><sup>[232]</sup></a>
but against the definite provisions of the Mosaic law;<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c009'><sup>[233]</sup></a> and over
and over again He demands from men such love, faith, submission,
obedience, as can be rightly given only to a Divine Master.<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c009'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>In Jesus of Nazareth, then, we have a historical person, whose
time and environment are well known to us, and whose teaching
and life also stand out clear and unmistakable; and the most
prominent thing about Him is this, that, by word and deed, and
finally by His crucifixion, He made it clear to all men that He
claimed to be both Son of Man and Son of God.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, then, we have the secret of that similarity which we are
all so clearly conscious of, when we read a Gospel alongside of the
<i>Gītā</i>. In the Gospels we have in historical form the authoritative
utterances of the historical Jesus; in the <i>Gītā</i> we have the
imaginations of a poet-philosopher who was clear sighted enough
to realize that an incarnate god would have many things to say
about himself, and that his teaching would bear the note of
authority. When, however, we look for exact parallels between
the two, they are hard to find: the books are so utterly diverse
in origin and teaching that they have little in common except the
tone of the master. In a few cases, however, the resemblance is
rather striking: here, then, we place side by side the words of
Jesus and the imaginations of the writer of the <i>Gītā</i>.</p>

things that Jesus has to say about His own person and mission,
but it may be well to quote a few passages exhibiting lines of
character and thought not exemplified above:—</p>

<p class='c005'>(<i><abbr class='spell'>a</abbr></i>) His meekness and lowliness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am meek and lowly in heart.” <i><abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr></i>, 11, 29.</p>

<p class='c012'>(<i><abbr class='spell'>b</abbr></i>) The conditions of His earthly life.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have
nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay His
head.” <i>Luke</i>, 9, 58.</p>

<p class='c012'>(<i><abbr class='spell'>c</abbr></i>) The necessity that He should die for men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And He began to teach them, that the Son of Man
must suffer many things, and be rejected by the
elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be
killed, and after three days rise again.” <i>Mark</i>, 8, 31.</p>

<p class='c012'>(<i><abbr class='spell'>d</abbr></i>) His spirit of service and self-sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Even as the Son of Man came not to be ministered
unto, but to minister, and to give His life a ransom
for many.” <i><abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr></i>, 20, 28.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But I am among you as he that doth serve.” <i>Luke</i>,
22, 27.</p>

<p class='c012'>(<i><abbr class='spell'>e</abbr></i>) His claims on the allegiance and love of men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Every one who shall confess Me before men, him shall
the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God:

be denied in the presence of the angels of God.”
<i>Luke</i>, 12, 8-9.</p>

<p class='c014'>“He that loveth father or mother more than Me is not

<p class='c012'>(<i><abbr class='spell'>h</abbr></i>) His presence with his followers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For where two or three are gathered together in My
name, there am I in the midst of them.” <i><abbr title='Matthew'>Matt.</abbr></i>,
18, 20.</p>

<hr class='c018'>

<p class='c005'>The <i>Gītā</i> is one of the most eloquent possible proofs of the
fact that the human heart cries out for an incarnate Saviour.
Scarcely less impressive is the evidence furnished by the reception
of the <i>Gītā</i> by Hindu readers: not the greatest of the Upanishads,
neither the <i>Chāndogya</i> nor the <i>Katha</i>, has had one
quarter of the influence exercised by this late poem; and the secret
undoubtedly is to be found in the attraction of the man-god
Krishna. How many generations of pious readers have found in
the story of the life and teaching of the incarnate god something
to which their deepest and most persistent religious instincts have
responded! How many to-day turn to Krishna in their trials and
troubles!</p>

<p class='c005'>On the one hand, then, we have the imaginative portrait of
Krishna, surrounded by millions of adoring worshippers—touching
spectacle! On the other, stands the historical Jesus of Nazareth,
Son of Man and Son of God, stretching out His nail-pierced
hands to India, as He says, “Come unto Me, all ye that labour
and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” Rightly read, the
<i>Gītā</i> is a clear-tongued prophecy of Christ, and the hearts that
bow down to the idea of Krishna are really seeking the incarnate
Son of God.</p>

<p class='c005'><abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>. We have been able to see some little distance into the
self-consciousness of Jesus, and to realize in part at least that
on which He grounds His claim to the heart of every man; but
we have not yet learned the secret of that most marvellous of
His powers, His power to win human love. To that we must
now address ourselves.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is a well-known fact of history that, shortly after the death
of Christ, His followers began to preach in His name, and that
very soon the new faith began to spread rapidly. We have already
learned from Tacitus that in 64 <abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr> there was “an immense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>multitude” of Christians in Rome itself. Now the greatest of all
the early missionaries was Paul. He was the apostle of Europe.
We mention his name here, because we wish to refer to one of his
Epistles. These letters are the earliest of our Christian documents.
The series begins with two brief letters, both written, with a short
interval between them, to the church at Thessalonica. The most
probable date for them is 49 <abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr>, that is, only twenty years after
the death of Christ. But the letter we wish to use is one sent from
Ephesus to the church of Corinth<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c009'><sup>[235]</sup></a> about 55 <abbr class='spell'>A. D.</abbr>,<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c009'><sup>[236]</sup></a> that is, twenty-six
years after the death of Jesus. We must not stay here to
speak of the splendour of the ethical feeling and teaching of the
Epistle further than to say that it manifestly has its source in Jesus.
We must direct our attention to other facts which appear in it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Christianity, we note, has already spread from Judæa
into the provinces of Asia<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c009'><sup>[237]</sup></a> and Galatia<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c009'><sup>[238]</sup></a> in Asia Minor, and
Macedonia<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c009'><sup>[239]</sup></a> and Achaia<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c009'><sup>[240]</sup></a> in Europe. Phœnicia, Syria, Cilicia and
Cyprus are not mentioned; but we know from other sources<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c009'><sup>[241]</sup></a>
that they too were already evangelized. Thus in twenty-six years
the Church of Christ has become a great organization, extending
through many lands, yet conscious of its unity in Christ.<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c009'><sup>[242]</sup></a> We
note also that then, as to-day, BAPTISM is a solemn ceremonial
act, in which a man through the action of the Holy Spirit becomes
a member of the body of Christ,<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c009'><sup>[243]</sup></a> while THE LORD’S SUPPER
is a recurrent feast, in which the members of the Church have
fellowship with the Lord and with each other.<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c009'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>But what we would call special attention to is <i>the place
assigned to Christ</i> in the Epistle. With reference to the Christian,

<p class='c005'>But there is another point still more noteworthy, and that is
<i>the way in which the crucifixion of Christ is interpreted</i>. Instead
of regarding that judicial murder as a regrettable incident, like
the assassination of Cæsar or the death of Socrates, Paul and his
fellow-believers glory in it,<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c009'><sup>[256]</sup></a> not only as the crowning event of the
divine revelation made in Christ, but as the consummation of His
work as the Saviour of men.<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c009'><sup>[257]</sup></a> Paul makes it the basis of all his
preaching,<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c009'><sup>[258]</sup></a> and in it he finds all the wealth of spiritual wisdom
which Christianity contains.<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c009'><sup>[259]</sup></a> He contrasts the wisdom of God
wrapped up in that divine tragedy with the worldly wisdom of
earthly rulers.<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c009'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>What can be the explanation of this extraordinary attitude to
such an event?—The basis of it is the solemn declaration, which
Paul makes in the Epistle, and which he says he made to his
converts first of all, that ON THE CROSS CHRIST DIED
FOR OUR SINS.<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c009'><sup>[261]</sup></a> The crucifixion, as a bare event in history,
is but an act of wicked folly on the part of the rulers of Judæa;
but, viewed from the standpoint of morality and religion, it is a
divine act of world-wide significance. In the blood of Christ a
new covenant had been made between God and man.<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c009'><sup>[262]</sup></a> This
is the Gospel, which all the Apostles teach, and which all the
churches believe.<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c009'><sup>[263]</sup></a> Through faith in Christ, on the basis of this
tremendous assertion, the Corinthian Christians, like the rest, had
been saved,<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c009'><sup>[264]</sup></a> <i><abbr class='spell'>i.e.</abbr></i>, they had received <i>the forgiveness of their sins</i><a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c009'><sup>[265]</sup></a>
and <i>the sanctifying Spirit</i>.<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c009'><sup>[266]</sup></a> They thus no longer belonged to
themselves: they had been bought with a great price, the blood of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the Son of God.<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c009'><sup>[267]</sup></a> They were no longer part and parcel of heathen
society; each one was a member of the body of Christ.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c009'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>What led Paul and all the other Apostles and all the early
Christians to form such an extraordinary theory? How did they
come to the conclusion that the crucifixion was not a squalid
tragedy, but a divine sacrifice? This letter tells us quite plainly;
the reasons were these: Jesus Himself declared before He was
crucified, that <i>His death was to be the basis of the New Covenant</i>,<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c009'><sup>[269]</sup></a>
and this declaration of His <i>had been divinely confirmed by His
Resurrection</i>.<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c009'><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Now mark: this letter was written within twenty-six years
of the event. The majority of the twelve Apostles, and multitudes
of other men who had known Jesus, were still alive.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c009'><sup>[271]</sup></a> Paul’s
good faith is beyond all question; and, as he was intimate with
Peter and John and the rest of the Apostles, and also with
James the brother of Jesus,<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c009'><sup>[272]</sup></a> he had access to the very best information
possible. Further he had been one of the most violent
opponents of Christianity. His testimony is, therefore, evidence
of the very highest value. We may conclude, then, with the
utmost certitude that we are standing on an immoveable historical
foundation, when we say that <i>Jesus, before His crucifixion, said
He was about to die for the sins of men</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this evidence does not stand alone. It is a historical
fact, acknowledged by scholars of every school, that all Christian
churches have from the very beginning celebrated the Lord’s
Supper.<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c009'><sup>[273]</sup></a> Now this universal usage in so many churches, divided
not only by long distances but in many cases also by minor differences
in doctrine, cannot be explained at all except as a result of
a command of Jesus Himself. If any single disciple had
started such a practice, it could never have won its way to universal
acceptance. Now consider the significance of this fact:
Jesus, on the night in which He was betrayed, took bread, broke
it, and bade His disciples eat it, saying, ‘This is My body.’ He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>then took a cup of wine and bade them drink it, saying, ‘This is
My blood.’<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c009'><sup>[274]</sup></a> The scene is absolutely without a parallel in the
history of the world; and it can have but one meaning, <i>viz.</i>, that
Jesus regarded His death as a sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the direct statement of Paul is corroborated, not only by
the institution of the Supper, but also by this fact, that the doctrine,
that Christ died for our sins, is an integral part of the
teaching of Jesus as that is handed down to us in the Gospels.
We have already seen that He held that His death was necessary
for the establishment of the Kingdom. We must now set out His
teaching on this subject with a little more fulness. We shall
restrict ourselves to a single Gospel. In the earliest saying that
refers to it, His death is a future event, coming inevitably, and
destined to bring sorrow to His disciples. “And Jesus said unto
them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn, as long as the
bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the
bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they
fast.”<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c009'><sup>[275]</sup></a> In the next it is much more clearly defined. Its necessity
is emphasized; we are told that the agents are to be the religious
leaders of Israel; and it is to be followed by the resurrection.
“From that time began Jesus to shew unto His disciples,
how that He must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the
third day be raised up.”<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c009'><sup>[276]</sup></a> Twice over this same prophecy is
repeated, the last time with more detail.<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c009'><sup>[277]</sup></a> Then follows a
most striking saying, in which He speaks of His death as voluntary:
it is a giving away of His life; and it is explained as the
climax of His life of service; for the gift is ‘a ransom for many,’
that is a price paid, in order to redeem many from sin. “The
Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and
to give His life a ransom for many.”<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c009'><sup>[278]</sup></a> We need not linger over
the next sayings, though each has its own interest.<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c009'><sup>[279]</sup></a> The last
saying occurs in the account of the institution of the Supper. In
these words He teaches in the clearest way, first, that His death
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>is to be the ground of forgiveness, and secondly, that after His
death He is to be the source of the spiritual life and strength
of His followers. “And as they were eating, Jesus took bread,
and blessed, and brake it; and He gave to the disciples, and
said, ‘Take, eat; this is My body.’ And He took a cup, and gave
thanks, and gave to them, saying, ‘Drink ye all of it; for this is My
blood of the covenant, which is shed for many unto remission of
sins.”<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c009'><sup>[280]</sup></a> The teaching of Jesus is an organic whole, and is incomplete
without this, His own interpretation of His death of shame.</p>

<p class='c005'>Jesus, then, gave Himself up to death as the sacrifice for the
sins of men. Our Christian documents go on to declare that <i>He
rose from the dead on the third day</i>, and that this resurrection of
His was God’s confirmation of the sacrifice of His Son. That
men should at first sight disbelieve the astounding assertion, that
the crucified Jesus rose from the dead, is not to be wondered at;
but <i>the fact remains</i>. Sceptical scholars have laboured for centuries
to explain away this extraordinary occurrence, but no one of these
scholars themselves will venture to say that any explanation
hitherto given is satisfactory. The latest attempt, that made by
Schmiedel in the <i>Encyclopædia Biblica</i>, is a farcical failure. The
following are the adamantine facts which no rationalism has ever
yet succeeded in crushing or melting:—(<i><abbr class='spell'>a</abbr></i>) the Christians declared
that they had seen Christ and spoken with Him after His resurrection;
(<i><abbr class='spell'>b</abbr></i>) they were absolutely sincere in this belief<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c009'><sup>[281]</sup></a>; (<i><abbr class='spell'>c</abbr></i>) the
Christian Church arose as a result of this conviction; (<i><abbr class='spell'>d</abbr></i>) the
grave was empty. The account of Christ’s appearances given in
the fifteenth chapter of our Epistle is well worth study. Those
who wish to look into this question further may consult Ballard’s
<i>Miracles of Unbelief</i>, <abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 135 <abbr class='spell'>ff.</abbr></p>

<p class='c005'>We have thus, by a serious historical inquiry, reached the
conclusion, that Jesus of Nazareth, the founder of the Christian
religion, declared, before His crucifixion, that He was about to
die for the sins of men, and that this assertion of His was sealed
with the divine approval by the unique miracle of the resurrection.
We have also seen that this was <i>the Good News</i>, which Paul and
all the other Apostles preached, and on which the early Church was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>founded. It is this that has won for Jesus the love of myriads;
it is this that has been the magnet to draw them away from sin.
It is the source of the joy and vital power of the Christian life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now let us recollect the poem upon <i>The Servant of Jehovah</i>,
which we considered in our third chapter. How marvellously
Jesus corresponds to the extraordinary idea which that poem
discloses, the despised and oppressed prisoner who endures in uncomplaining
meekness the uttermost shame of a violent death,
and is finally recognized as having been “pierced because of our
trangressions, and crushed because of our iniquities.” That anyone
should write such a poem, seems strange in the extreme;
that Jesus should have fulfilled it, is infinitely more wonderful.</p>

<p class='c005'>How comes it that this Jewish carpenter, with His three
years of public life and His cross of shame, fulfils so many ideals
and aspirations? He brings in the new age which Virgil and his
contemporaries sighed for; He is Plato’s just man; He utters
from His own self-consciousness such things as the author of the
<i>Gītā</i> imagined an incarnate god would say; He gives Himself up
to death, in sheer love, as a sacrifice for sin, thus fulfilling the
deepest needs of man, as expressed by the old Hebrew seer; and
He is the only human being whom men of every race and clime
can heartily admire and unhesitatingly imitate. Nor is this all:
many other convergent lines of thought might be suggested, in
the light of which Jesus stands out as the ideal of our common
humanity and the fountain of the love of God.</p>

<p class='c005'>How is all this to be explained? Wide chasms sever the
Hindu sage, the Greek philosopher, the Hebrew prophet and the
Roman poet; yet in Jesus their several ideals are reconciled in a
loftier unity. Once in the course of the centuries East and West
have actually met! Nor was the meeting merely the resolution of
antitheses in a wider conception: what the Jew and the Indian,
the Greek and the Roman, dreamed of as the unattainable, that
Jesus actually accomplished in this work-a-day world of ours,
amid storms of the cruellest hatred and calumny.—What is
your candid opinion about Him, brother? How are you to solve
the problem raised by His life, death and place in history? Can
He be better described than in His own words, SON OF MAN
and SON OF GOD?</p>

  <h2 id='appendix' class='c006'>APPENDIX. <br> NEO-KRISHNA LITERATURE.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'>The Neo-Krishna movement is about twenty years old. Before
1880 Vaishnavism does not seem to have been in great favour
with the higher castes of Bengal. Traditionally they were Saivas
or Sāktas rather than Vaishnavas; and English education, which
bore very heavily for half a century on every form of Hinduism
seems to have told with peculiar severity on Krishnaism. But
shortly after 1880 a great change becomes visible: Krishna begins
to be praised on every hand, and ancient Vaishnava books are
read and studied with avidity. The new movement seems to have
owed its origin, on the one hand, to the teaching and influence of
Ramkrishna Paramhansa, Keshub Chundra Sen, Bijoy Krishna
Goswami and Shishir Kumar Ghose; and on the other, to the
efforts of two or three noteworthy literary men, who threw themselves
into the task of painting the character of Krishna with extraordinary
enthusiasm. The <i>Gītā</i> at once leaped into greater prominence
than ever: numberless editions and translations of it
have been published. Many essays have appeared comparing
Krishna with Christ and Vaishnavism with Christianity. Thus
a large Krishna literature, both in English and Bengali, has sprung
up. The following seem to be the more important books of this

<p class='c012'>This revival of interest in Krishna and his worship is clearly
part of the great national movement which has been so potent in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>Bengal, religiously, socially and politically, these last twenty
years. This period has witnessed the appearance of the whole
Neo-Hindu movement, with its literature, lectures, societies and
missionary propaganda, the rise of the Indian National Congress
and of the social reform movement, the advance of native
journalism to its present extraordinary influence, and the establishment
of the native unaided colleges, which have so seriously
changed the balance of influence in Higher Education. Neo-Krishnaism,
then, is one result of the operation of that potent
spirit whereby India has become conscious of her unity, and her
sons have been roused to a vigorous defence of all that they have
inherited from the past. This rise of the national spirit, though
it may be troublesome in small matters to the rulers of India,
is undoubtedly the last and greatest justification of English rule;
and, while, with its exaggerations and insincerities and follies, it
cannot fail to provoke criticism,<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c009'><sup>[282]</sup></a> yet its power to awake self-reliance,
self-respect and the passion for freedom ought to win
for it the approval and the encouragement of all good men.</p>

<p class='c005'>There can be no doubt that among the influences which
have produced Neo-Hinduism, Christianity is one of the most
potent, if not the chief. This is peculiarly evident in the case
of the Neo-Krishna literature we are discussing. In 1899 the
Bengal Librarian wrote, “There is no denying the fact that all
this revolution in the religious belief of the educated Hindu has
been brought about as much by the dissemination of Christian
thought by Missionaries as by the study of Hindu scriptures; for
Christian influence is plainly detectable in many of the Hindu
publications of the year.” But beyond this general influence,
which cannot fail to be noticed by anyone who will take the
trouble to read the volumes, it is, we believe, perfectly plain that
the very ideas which have given birth to the literature are the
result of Christian influence. A distinct taste for such books
as the Gospels has sprung up; and men have come to feel the
need of a perfect character, such as Christ’s is, for daily contemplation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and imitation. The Neo-Krishna movement endeavours
to supply these needs from within Hinduism, offering the <i>Gītā</i>
instead of the Gospels, and Krishna instead of Christ.<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c009'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Nobin Ch. Sen seems to have been the first to conceive the
idea of a modern rendering of the character of Krishna; for he
laid the project before some of his friends in 1882.<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c009'><sup>[284]</sup></a> His famous
epic trilogy, <i>Raivatak</i>, <i>Kurukshetra</i> and <i>Prabhās</i>, are the result
of this pregnant thought. But, while he and Shishir Kumar
Ghose have done a great deal to popularize the movement, there
can be no doubt that Bunkim Ch. Chatterji’s <i>Krishnacharitra</i>
has been by far the most influential volume in the whole of this
literature. Gaur Gavinda Ray’s work, <i>Srikrishner Jivana O
Dharma</i>, is a piece of excellent characterization, and has won the
high regard of many thoughtful men.</p>

<p class='c005'>The books on our list fall into two classes, <i>Historical</i> and
<i>Traditional</i>. In the Historical class there are only two volumes,
Tattvabhusan’s <i>Hindu Theism</i>, and the <i>Young Men’s Gītā</i>. These
two frankly acknowledge that the <i>Gītā</i> is a late book. In the
<i>Young Men’s Gītā</i><a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c009'><sup>[285]</sup></a> its date is said to be a century or two before,
or a century or two after, the Christian era; while in <i>Hindu
Theism</i><a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c009'><sup>[286]</sup></a> the <i>Gītā</i> is regarded as the point of transition from the
old Vedānta to the religion of the Purānas. The standpoint of
these two books is thus thoroughly historical, but it necessarily
implies the abandonment of the divinity of Krishna.</p>

<p class='c005'>All the rest of the books on the list fall into the second class;
for they hold the traditional position about Krishna. Most of
them make no attempt at criticism of the sources, but treat the
<i>Mahābhārata</i>, the <i>Gītā</i>, the <i>Harivansa</i> and the Purānas as all
historical and all equally trustworthy. A few of the authors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>however, state plainly their own critical conclusions, and two or
three enter into some discussion of the main problems. These
attempts at criticism are the most pitiable parts of the whole
literature. The talented author of <i>Srikrishner Jivana O Dharma</i>,
by far too sincere and candid to ignore the Puranic elements in
the sources, frankly confesses their presence; yet, believing
these books to be genuine representatives of the age of Kurukshetra,
he is driven to the extraordinary conclusion that the Vedic,
the Vedantic, and the Puranic ages were contemporaneous.<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c009'><sup>[287]</sup></a> The
late Bulloram Mullick, in discussing the eighteen Purānas, goes so
far as to say, “Whatever may be the views of European savants,
there is indubitable proof that some of these Purānas existed in
the eleventh or twelfth century before Christ.”<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c009'><sup>[288]</sup></a> Even Bunkim
Chundra Chatterji himself not only unhesitatingly adopts Goldstücker’s
rash guess, that Pānini’s grammar was written before the
Brāhmanas and the Upanishads, but on the basis of that unwise
conjecture, pushes back Pānini’s date to the tenth or eleventh
century <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>,<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c009'><sup>[289]</sup></a> <i><abbr class='spell'>i.e.</abbr></i>, four or five centuries earlier than the pre-Buddhistic
date which Goldstücker<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c009'><sup>[290]</sup></a> wished to establish. Dhirendra
Nath Pal, seeing that Bunkim Babu found it so easy to leap over
a few centuries, goes a little further and suggests the twelfth or
thirteenth.<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c009'><sup>[291]</sup></a> But, indeed, without some such strange perversion
of history, it is impossible to construct an argument for the
authenticity of the <i>Gītā</i> and the historicity of the <i>Mahābhārata</i>
that shall have even the semblance of reason.</p>

<p class='c005'>We note next that of all the books of the second class,
Bunkim Chundra’s <i>Krishnacharitra</i> is the only work that gives
any independent criticism: all the rest, with the single exception
of <i>Srikrishner Jivana O Dharma</i>, merely echo his arguments.
Thus Bunkim Babu’s theory is the only one we need discuss.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the whole critical structure of the <i>Krishnacharitra</i>
rests upon the passage on pages 41 and 42, where the date of
Pānini is discussed. Pānini is pushed back to 1000 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>; and,
the ‘original’ <i>Mahābhārata</i> being earlier than Pānini, we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>asked to believe that it was produced within a century or two of
Kurukshetra, and that it is in consequence trustworthy historically.
The whole argument thus rests on the date of Pānini.</p>

<p class='c005'>We translate this important passage:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Goldstücker has proved that, when Pānini’s Sūtra was composed,
Buddha had not arisen. In that case Pānini must belong to the sixth
century <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> But not only that, in his time the Brāhmanas, the Aranyakas,
the Upanishads and the other parts of the Vedas had not been composed.
Apart from the Rig, the Yajur, and the Sāma Vedas, nothing else existed.
Asvalāyana, Sānkhāyana and the rest had not appeared. Max Müller says
that the age in which the Brāhmanas were composed began about 1000 <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>
Dr. Martin Haug says that that was the end of the age, and that it began in
the fourteenth century <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr> Therefore, if we say that Pānini must belong
to the tenth or eleventh century <abbr class='spell'>B. C.</abbr>, we do not say too much.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Now the first remark we make on this extraordinary piece of
criticism is this, that Goldstücker and Max Müller are most
unfairly conjoined to support a date which both of them would
have indignantly repudiated. For Müller’s date for Pānini is the
fourth century <abbr class='spell'>B.C.</abbr>,<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c009'><sup>[292]</sup></a> and Goldstücker never proposed to push
him further back than the sixth century; indeed all that he claims
is that he has brought forward evidence which affords a strong
<i>probability</i> that Pānini preceded the origin of the Buddhistic
creed.<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c009'><sup>[293]</sup></a> Our next remark is that, though more than forty years
have passed since Goldstücker’s book appeared,<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c009'><sup>[294]</sup></a> he has convinced
no one that the Brāhmanas and the Upanishads are posterior to
Pānini’s grammar: opinions still differ as to Pānini’s precise date,
but no scholar to-day puts him before the Brāhmanas.<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c009'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c005'>Can the grounds for this unanimity among modern scholars
be vividly set forth? We believe they can. Here, as in our first
chapter, we shall not attempt to fix a definite chronology, but shall
simply aim at reaching <i>the relative age</i> of the great books we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>dealing with; and we shall not deal with the meaning of disputed
passages, but shall rest the case altogether on the clear and
prominent features of history which every one can appreciate.
There is, then, first of all the great broad fact that the Sūtras
depend on the Brāhmanas, and are, in general, posterior to them,
and that <i>the language and style of Pānini’s Sūtras show that he
belongs to about the middle of the Sūtra period</i>.<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c009'><sup>[296]</sup></a> All the detailed
study of the last forty years <i>has gone to strengthen this stable
conclusion</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there is another and still more conclusive proof that Pānini
comes long after the early Brāhmanas. <i>These ancient books are
written in Vedic Sanskrit.</i><a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c009'><sup>[297]</sup></a> The early Upanishads are more
modern in character, but even they belong to a stage of the language
a good deal earlier than the Sūtras: Professor Macdonell’s
words are, “the oldest Upanishads occupying a position linguistically
midway between the Brāhmanas and the Sūtras.”<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c009'><sup>[298]</sup></a> Thus
the Brāhmanas were composed while Vedic Sanskrit was still the
language of the Indo-Aryans. Now Pānini’s grammar <i>deals with
classical Sanskrit</i>, not the Vedic speech. He deals with many
points of Vedic grammar, it is true, but he deals with them as
exceptions; his subject is classical Sanskrit. He laid down the
law, which has ruled Sanskrit throughout the centuries since his
day. Thus he arose at a time, <i>when the language of the Brāhmanas
had become archaic</i>, and modern Sanskrit had taken its place.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c009'><sup>[299]</sup></a> It
is thus absolutely impossible to believe that Pānini lived and wrote
before the Brāhmanas were composed: to propose to put him back
before their composition is much the same as proposing to push
Johnson’s Dictionary back before Chaucer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another line of proof may also be indicated. Careful study
of the early Brāhmanas has made it plain that they were composed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>after the collection of the hymns of the <i>Rigveda</i>, but before<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c009'><sup>[300]</sup></a> the
formation of the <i>Sanhitā</i> text (<i><abbr class='spell'>i.e.</abbr></i>, the text in which the words are
joined according to the rules of <i>Sandhi</i>) and the <i>Pada</i><a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c009'><sup>[301]</sup></a> text (<i><abbr class='spell'>i.e.</abbr></i>
the word by word text). The author of the <i>Pada</i> text is Sākalya.<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c009'><sup>[302]</sup></a>
Now Yāska refers to Sākalya as a predecessor;<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c009'><sup>[303]</sup></a> and Yāska
himself is earlier than Pānini.<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c009'><sup>[304]</sup></a> Thus the historical order is the
early Brāhmanas, the <i>Sanhitā</i> text, Sākalya, Yāska, Pānini.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bunkim Babu’s date for Pānini being thus altogether untenable,
his whole argument for the historicity of the <i>Pāndava
Mahābhārata</i> and Krishna’s character as therein pourtrayed
tumbles in ruins, and brings down with it all the rest of this
Krishna literature.</p>

<p class='c005'>We would invite our readers to turn away from these vain
attempts to turn a myth into sober history, and to listen to the
teaching of those really scholarly Indians who study Hinduism
from a scientific standpoint. We have already referred to
Sitanath Tattvabhushan’s <i>Hindu Theism</i>, and we have frequently
used Bose’s <i>Hindu Civilization under British Rule</i> and <abbr class='spell'>R. C.</abbr> Dutt’s
works as authorities. We would now call attention to a monograph
by one of the greatest scholars in Bengal (<i>Comparative
Studies in Vaishnavism and Christianity</i>, by Brajendra Nath
Seal), where<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c009'><sup>[305]</sup></a> the growth of the Krishna legend is frankly discussed;<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c009'><sup>[306]</sup></a>
also to a very remarkable essay on <i>Buddhist and
Vishnuite</i> in a recent number of <i>Sāhitya</i><a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c009'><sup>[307]</sup></a> by the late Umes
Chundra Batabyal, in which grave historical reasons are given
for concluding that the <i>Gītā</i> is in part at least a polemic against
Buddhism; and to the late Mr. Justice Telang’s introduction to
his translation of the <i>Gītā</i> (<i><abbr class='spell'>S. B. E.</abbr></i>, vol. VIII), with regard to
which readers will note, that, although the date is put a little
earlier than most scholars would put it, no attempt is made to
defend the traditional theory of the origin of the Song.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r71'>71</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>Mr. Justice Telang was inclined to put the date before the third century
<abbr class='spell'>B.C.</abbr>, but his otherwise most judicious criticism is faulty in this that it does not
take all the factors of the problem into consideration. Others, such as Müller,
Weber, Davies and Lorinser, incline to a very late date, about the third century
<abbr class='spell'>A.D.</abbr> Most writers believe that the true date lies between these extremes.
So Monier-Williams, Hopkins, Fraser and others. Prof. Amalnerkar’s
pamphlet contains a number of most interesting points. His contention, that
the phrase, <i>Brahmasūtrapadaih</i> (<i><abbr class='spell'>G.</abbr></i> <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII</abbr>, 4) refers to the <i>Vedānta Sūtras</i>,
and that the <i>Gītā</i> is therefore the later work of the two, has been accepted by
Max Müller (<i><abbr class='spell'>S. S. I. P.</abbr></i>, 155), but Prof. Hopkins thinks the <i>Gītā</i> is earlier
than the Sūtra (<i><abbr class='spell'>R. I.</abbr></i>, 400). The theory which Prof. Hopkins holds, that
the Divine Song was originally an Upanishad, and that it was redacted, first
as a Vishuite poem, and then a second time in the interests of Krishnaism
(<i><abbr class='spell'>R. I.</abbr></i>, 389), would account, on the one hand, for the numerous inconsistencies
in its teaching, and, on the other, for the very conflicting signs of date which
it presents. For a criticism of Bunkim Chundra’s views, <i>see</i> the Appendix.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='label'><a href='#r103'>103</a>.&#160;&#160;</span>This is Telang’s translation of two very difficult, yet very instructive
phrases. In the <i>Gītā</i> the word <i>prakriti</i> is used, first for the primeval matter
of the Sānkhya system (<abbr title='three'>III</abbr>, 27; 29; <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr>, 8, 10, 12; <abbr title='thirteen'>XIII</abbr>, 19, 20, 23, 29),
and secondly for the primeval matter of personal character, each man’s
natural disposition (<abbr title='three'>III</abbr>, 33; <abbr title='seven'>VII</abbr>, 20; <abbr title='eleven'>XI</abbr>, 51; <abbr title='eighteen'>XVIII</abbr>, 59). There is then a
third class of passages in which the word is used in the Sānkhyan sense, but,
<i>by the addition of a personal pronoun</i>, <i>prakriti</i> is made to belong to Krishna
personally (<abbr title='seven'>VII</abbr>, 4, 5; <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr>, 7, 13). Here we have one of the devices our
author employed to give the great old phrases a vivid personal colouring.
Now such a phrase as “my prakriti” is already ambiguous; so we are not
surprised to meet with two passages, in which it is impossible to tell whether
the meaning is metaphysical or ethical (<abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>, 6; <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr>, 8). Probably the author
intended to suggest both meanings. Most translators take the meaning to be
metaphysical, but Telang may be right in taking it as ethical: Krishna is
regarded as the ideal of Action Yoga. For a similar use of the personal
pronoun compare <i>sarvakarmāni mayi sannyasya</i> (<abbr title='eighteen'>XVIII</abbr>, 57) with <i>sarvakarmāni
sannyasya</i> of the <i>Paramahansopanishad</i>. Pages 706, 708 and 709 of
Jacob’s <i>Concordance to the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavadgītā</i> are peculiarly
instructive in this connection.</p>

not include the Bibles sold by the ordinary publishers of Christian countries,
nor the Bibles sold in Europe by Bible Societies. If it were possible to gather
